      "Good post. I'd like to add a few things, if I may. I owned computer stores for about 6 years and have fixed thousands of computers. In addition, we did onsite tech support and the things I've learned over the years made my life much easier, so without further ado:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Build confidence 1st: When you show up, make sure you look like someone they'd be happy to let in their house. If you have long hair, make sure it's neat. If you have facial piercings, take them out. Wear khakis and a polo shirt. This may all seem like bullshit, but let's be honest, much of your customer base will be older and frankly, they will be instantly prejudiced against someone who looks like what they consider to be a thug. Be confident and comforting. *LISTEN* to them. The more time you spend letting them tell you about what happened with the computer, the better prepared you'll be to deal with it. With that said, keep the conversation focused on the computer. You're there to help them out, not hear about their cat. Don't accept coffee, tea, cookies, or anything like that. You want to appear professional. Your tools should be organized and clean. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Work quickly and tell them what you're doing, while you're doing it. Explain every facet of your work. If it's a hardware issue, explain what you're doing and why.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Bring paperwork. Before you TOUCH their computer, have them sign a form that indemnifies you from any damage. You're working on a system that's broken, so write on the form specifically what's wrong, note what actions you're taking to fix them, and have them sign both before and after you're done. The first signature is to show they're authorizing you to work on it, the second to document that they're satisfied. This will help you on rework claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Before you do a data transfer or a virus removal, make sure you explain the risks. People don't like to do this, but it's critical. About 1 in 1000 times, a hard drive will fail during a virus removal. The reason is that most hard drives aren't stressed that hard during normal use and you'll be working on systems that are 10+ years old sometimes. If you're doing a wipe/reload, make sure everything they want is transferred. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Test, test, test. Before you tell a customer they need a new computer, test the hell out of it. It's easy to show the customer a screen with a bunch of red indicating their drive is hosed. It's hard to simply tell them they lost gram-grams only photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Learn to troubleshoot quickly and accurately. This comes from practice but you can help yourself by bringing along the right tools. Also, check out this flowchart. It's pretty good. http://www.fonerbooks.com/poster.pdf\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Bring good tools. They are, in no particular order -- Power Supply Tester, electric screwdriver with torque control, extra screws, Hirens disk, extra SATA cable, extra IDE cable, Flash drive, air compressor (canned air can suffice in a pinch, but you'll run into some ungodly filthy computers that require more power), windex, paper towels, a notebook computer, and an external hard drive enclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Understand that you aren't there to fix their computer -- you're there to solve a problem. Figure out what that problem is 1st, fix their computer second. Ex. Let's say they can't get internet access and they're frantic. Find out *why* they're frantic. Sometimes the issue is they have to send out a critical email, maybe they need a special document for school, or whatever. You need to be able to offer creative solutions if their system is hosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. After you've fixed their computer, MAKE SURE THEY USE IT AND CAN VALIDATE THAT THE PROBLEM THEY HAD IS GONE. I can't stress this highly enough. Let them sit down and play with the system for a few minutes. This will give them more confidence in you, your work, and their newly fixed system.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Give bad news gently. If their mobo is bad, show them the swollen or leaking caps (if they are there). If their hard drive is clicking, let them hear it, tell them their options (send off for recovery, etc.). Make sure they know that it wasn't their fault. If their system is riddled with spyware, leave them a sheet with common ways to avoid getting it in the future. Be kind but firm. Remember, you've already shown them the tests that indicate *why* something failed, so it shouldn't come as a shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Prepare them before you start. When they say, \"My hard drive won't turn on,\" you tell them that when a system won't start up, there are many reasons -- some are simple to fix, some are complex, but you will walk them through the process, every step of the way. If you suspect their hard drive is bad, tell them that you're concerned about it, but you're going to check it out to make sure. Don't work in quiet, then tell them, \"Yeah, it's dead. Everything is gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "12. When you're done and they're satisfied, tape your business card to their computer and tell them that you're available if they have any more questions. \n",
      "\n",
      "13. Bring extra parts. There's no reason not to have an extra 450+ watt power supply, molex splitters, cables, and RAM with you at all times. It's an easy sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Sell upgrades. If you get to someone's house and they only have 512mb of RAM, bump it up by a GB, then let them see the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Don't forget to tune it up. MSCONFIG is your friend, but remember to make sure every function they did before still works. Too many people disable all sorts of services but forget to re-enable the printer ones. You don't want angry calls that require you to go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Clean their computer screen and keyboard for them. This may seem stupid, but it's critical. Most of the work you're doing can't be seen -- it's just a bunch of keystrokes. If you clean up their computer, it looks better and they'll feel better about it. When I take my car in, the dealer washes it before they give it back, and even if it's a simple brake job, I feel better about the whole thing. The idea is, you're providing VALUE, not just emergency service. Which brings me to the last piece...\n",
      "\n",
      "17. Don't apologize for charging them. You have a skill set they don't. You came to their house, you solved their problem, and you are worth what you charge, so don't be embarrassed. On the other hand, don't nickel and dime them. When you suspect what the problem is, give them a high range and a low range of how much it might cost. EX: \"Ma'am, your system won't turn on (don't say boot up) so there are a few things that might be wrong with it. If it's the power supply, it's just going to be $59 to fix and I have a replacement one in the car. If the motherboard is bad, that can run hundreds of dollars and it might be worthwhile to replace the system, but let's test it out and I'll be able to recommend the most cost effective solution.\" By setting their expectations, you prepare them for the worst. When it's just a power supply and their computer is up and running again, you have a happy customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Ok, I lied. One mroe thing -- give value. Let's say you fixed their power supply. Tune up their system too. Check their antivirus subscriptions. Check their RAM usage. Check their disk fragmentation (I like Iobit's tool as well as Acronix's, but to each his own). You want them to feel like they got a bargain because they called you and you want them to tell all their friends about you. It's not enough that you repaired their computer. You need to *fix their problem* and do it quickly, professionally, and inexpensively. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you do this, your business will grow quickly and you'll have awesome customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, one last thing -- you can't please everyone. Some people will be horrible to you no matter what, so don't fret. Cut them loose, leave, and don't bother with them again. You're doing everything you can to protect yourself by having them sign papers, by being friendly, and by knowing your shit, but there are people out there who will try to fuck you over, just because they suck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, hope this helps. I could write a book about this (actually, I did, but it's under my real name) but this should help you get started.\n",
      "I would add to your list of things you want to have:\n",
      "\n",
      "Some extra cables, ones to hook up another hdd specifically. (sata, ide, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A flash drive with a Live Linux distro installed, maybe one targeted at PC repair. Even if it's not your thing, or you're not experienced in Linux there is some that are very user friendly and it makes migrating hdd's or testing corrupt files much easier.\n",

So one day I decided to put myself out there on craigslist, and have learned many of these things as I've become successful doing it.  I started out doing this with literally a phillips screw driver and my home computer.  I now have a new car, an ipad I use solely for work, and all kinds of stuff, plus the ability to work from home, life is good. \n",

      "Pricing\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "People come to craigslist to get deals and to save some money, realize that when your writing your ad.  First lesson I learned pretty fast, is hourly rates DO NOT WORK. In the first two weeks of doing this, I initially charged $25 an hour, I got one customer in 2 weeks. Charge a flat rate!  \n",
      "I charge a flat rate and plan on my jobs being fixed or resolved in under 2 hours.  My charge is what I expect to do for 2 hours of work.  So If you want to make $25 an hour, charge $50 to fix someones computer.  This is a HUGE undercut of store services or the Geek squad or staples, your making a great wage, and Saving people a TON of money! You will be absolutely surprised at how often you'll get jobs that take only 20-30 mins to fix, then you just made $50 for 20 mins worth of work!  Conversely tho, this is a #'s game, and you will run into jobs that end up taking for longer to fix than you originally planned.  PATIENCE!!! Doing this kind of work will earn you FUTURE MONEY, suck it up and DO IT, NO COMPLAINTS to the customer either, JUST FIX IT!  I've done screen replacements on unibody macbooks for $30 before, JUST DO IT!\n",

      "Craigslist ads search off of the title and the body of the message.  Make sure to ad things like pc repair, mac, etc to the bottom of the ad to make sure it gets the most visibility.  Your ad will get flagged from time to time, and don't take it personally.  There are quite a few people who make their money off of craigslist and your now a competitor.  Have a good smartphone, get your email on your phone and repost the ad when it gets flagged, and THEY WILL GET FLAGGED.  Your ad can be reposted 5x a day before your account gets locked til the next day.  When someone flags your post, thats great, you just got to top post it for another at least 30 mins.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It can be easy to develop flag and ad anxiety if this is your sole income, don't sweat it and just realize that these people are wasting more of their time than yours and enjoy the advertising \"reminder\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "Keep your ad primarily in computer gigs, if possible also in the barter section if your willing to take trades.  I have gotten so many tools, tablets, mp3 players, movies, tv's, tattoos, etc from having my ad in the barter section it really pays itself off. Got paid in gold dust once, that was kind of cool!\n",

      "Helpful software\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "Ninite - Ninite.com saves me so much time since I probably do a windows install EVERY SINGLE DAY.  People love getting free software and MANY of your customers don't know that the words Free and Antivirus can exist in the same sentence.  You handing out free copies of Microsoft security essentials and open office is like giving lil charlie a golden ticket to your customers!  \n",
      "Rkill, TDSSKILLER, Malwarebytes, OTM, Gooredfix -  Common tools to remove viruses.  All very useful and can fix most \"viruses\".  There are tons of other alternatives to these, and use w/e your the most comfortable with, but I've found these are fast, lightweight, and easy to use for users, as many times I'll leave a copy with the customer to help themselves in the future.\n",
      "WinToFlash - This will let you \"burn\" any version of windows to a bootable usb stick and install it from it, just like the CD.  Great laptops with broken dvd drives and netbooks, etc. \n",
      "Other things I keep around are common registry tweaks, like default_exe, taskmanager.reg, wallpaperenable.reg, InstallTake_ownership.reg, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Key tips!\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "1.  Your customers think of you in the same way that many people think of mechanics.  They don't trust you, they think your going to try to screw them over. You will have to prove through your words and your actions that you are worthy of trust.  Trust is your absolute best asset towards growing this kind of business.\n",
      "2.  Many of your customers will be people that are FAR FAR FAR from literate with a computer.  Patience and GOOD customer service are FAR more important to the benefit of your business than your actual skill with the computer.  Patience will get you repeat customers!  Repeat customers are the heartbeat of what you do, NEVER take any customer for granted.  I helped a lady in a Starbucks once, she told her boss about me, I got a $1500 EMR contract to help migrate his dentist office to a new medical billing system.  \n",
      "3.  Be realistic and DON'T scare people.  People don't want to hear \"You have 300x things wrong with your computer\".  They want to hear \"Oh, don't worry about that too much, I can fix it!\"  You will become their go to computer guy for anything.  Be prepared to take phone calls and don't charge people for stuff like this.  If your willing to bend a little and help people out, they won't be afraid to toss money at you like it's setting their wallets on fire.  I once drove 30 miles to a guy's house to fix his WiFi only to find the WiFi switch was off, I didn't charge him and I've earned him as a repeat customer, and probably made $150 off of him over the course of a year.  If i didn't eat the initial visit, I don't know If he would've kept me around.\n",
      "4. Be prepared to not make much for a while until your name gets out there.  Your reputation is WORTH WAY MORE THAN ANY SINGLE JOB! \n",
      "Do not take any job your not comfortable with, or don't think you can fix.  Be honest and upfront with people about expectations, and do your best to empower your customers to fix things themselves.  They'll trust you and pay you for the convenience!  Stand by WHAT YOU SAY, and be willing to go the extra mile for your customers, THEY WILL LOVE YOU!\n",
      "5. Take pictures of your customers on your phone, and write a small note on their contact (if you have a smartphone) so that you can remember them and what you did for them.  You'll be helping lots of people every month and it can be very hard to remember them all, but people love knowing you remember them.\n",
      "6. BE SAFE!  Write down any addresses to new customers and keep them around at your home if you don't know these people.  Let people know where your going.  You are dealing with people off of craigslist, yes most people are awesome, but be prepared for the crazies, which you WILL run into eventually. (yes, I Have crazy people stories)\n",
      "\n",
      "Tools Recommendations\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "1. A precision screw driver set WITH HANDLES, do not get the skinny ones, you'll hate yourself for it.  Something like this is good. \n",
      "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PADNxaDfL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\n",
      "2. A set of normal steel-shafted screwdrivers.  Stanley has a great set of steel-shaft screwdrivers with an interchangeable handle (not head).  Cost like $10\n",
      "3. A solder gun (if you know how, this can increase the variety of jobs you can take) $7 at radio shack. $3 for solder. \n",
      "4. An anti-static wristband is typically about $5-7 and is easiest to find in one of those computer toolkits, but can easily be ordered off of amazon also.  \n",
      "5. A can of compressed air\n",
      "6. A tiny flashlight of some kind. No, your phone is not good enough, Go buy a $1 TINY flashlight that you can hold in one hand without having to mess with touchscreens, it will instantly become your favorite tool.\n",
      "7. At minimum a 4gb flash drive. That you can keep on your keychain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, thats all I can think of for right now.  I'll answer any questions anybody has, and best of luck all of you!\n",

      "Begin preheating a large dutch oven or pot.\n",
      "Step 2:\n",
      "Mince your onion.\n",
      "Prep your garlic for the press. Remove any green stems.\n",
      "Prepare your meat as you like.\n",
      "Step 3:\n",
      "Empty the tomatoes into a large mixing bowl.\n",
      "Add the spices, anchovies, and vodka.\n",
      "Eyeball the amounts.\n",
      "Drain as much oil from the anchovy tin as you can into the garbage.\n",
      "<em>This is done because the oil in canned Cento anchovies is low-quality in my opinion. This oil is a strong source of flavor you may choose to use.</em>\n",
      "Mix and crush everything thoroughly with your hands until you have a nice sauce.\n",
      "Step 4:\n",
      "<em>If you aren't using meat, use some butter and high-quality EVOO as a fat substitute.</em>\n",
      "Brown your choice of meat. I used pork belly this time.\n",

      "<em>The onion will release enough moisture to de-glaze the pan. Use downward pressure when stirring to scrape off the fond.</em>\n",
      "Use a garlic press to add your desired amount of garlic. Stir until it smells so good other people begin making comments (about 1-2 minutes).\n",
      "Step 6:\n",
      "Add the 'maters!\n",
      "Reduce heat to medium-low once they start to simmer.\n",
      "Add dried mushrooms if you want. These are dried <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus_edulis\" target=\"_blank\">boletus</a></em>, AKA Porcini mushrooms.\n",
      "Zest a lemon in there. If you're a real lemon freak like I am, squeeze the juice in there too.\n",

      "Step 7:\n",
