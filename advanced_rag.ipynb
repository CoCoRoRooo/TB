Parfois, le PC démarre après plusieurs tentatives ou manipulations (éteindre/rallumer, débrancher/rebrancher, vérifier les connexions internes). Le problème peut aussi se manifester après un choc ou un déplacement du boîtier, ou de façon aléatoire.\n",

      "- Inspecter les câbles pour détecter d’éventuels dommages.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 5 : Vérification de l’alimentation**\n",
