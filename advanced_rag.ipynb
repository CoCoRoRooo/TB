Answer them (with exception of giving out any personal information - always read command outputs that you are copying and pasting and feel free to censor any sensitive info) as thoughtfully as you can even though you may think the answer is not relevant to your problem.

Unfortunately it seems these companies have no problem selling expensive gaming laptops but refuse to actually support them or even admit that they are dangerous due to them generally using power adapters that can barely meet demand and thermal designs that aren\\'t up to spec.

There is a component that is failing when the system is powered by battery. This is due to normal wear and tear and is not considered to be a potential safety issue.\\n\\n We are shipping the system back to you since the warranty on the system does not encourage any repairs unless you pay for the repairs to complete. I will update you once the tracking details are available.\\n\\n Regards,\\n\\nSuneel Prasad\\n\\nDell | Executive Customer Support Team\"\\n\\n \\n   This was the email I had received by the Dell representative Suneel Prasad in an attempt to close the complaint I had opened months ago about my Dell Alienware laptop catching fire.  Only 3 months prior to my Dell laptop catching fire, there had been issues with the computer straight out of the factory.  Dell had my laptop returned to them and fixed the issues, deeming it safe for use.\\n  After my laptop had spewed fire out of then back, leaving scorch marks on my desk, I contacted Dell and they simply told me \"If you are out of warranty then we unfortunately cannot do anything for you Sir\", with absolutely no concern for the fire.  I contacted the Better Business Bureau to assist with my case, and so they did.  \\n  After the Executive Dell Support team from Austin, Texas had been contacted it took months for the case to go anywhere.  This is mainly because Dell had lied to the BBB and myself, saying that they had already had an examination team examining my laptop and that they had found nothing of harm.  At this point, I had not sent Dell my laptop yet (I have this email documented from Dell).\\n   After I had caught them in their lie, Dell immediately sent me a box to return the laptop to them for actual examination.\\n   A month after sending them the laptop, Dell responded to me with the email stating that no component they had found was of any harm, and the incident was caused by normal \"wear and tear\".\\n  Regardless of what component has failed, and regardless of why it has failed, fire and smoke have came out of the back of the computer.  The inner components of the computer wouldn\\'t be scorched and melted unless they were heated to a temperature where fire was produced.  There is very clear evidence showed in the pictures I had taken of the laptops inner components.  It has become a regular occurrence for Dell to now tell me that my case is harmless.  I realize now that Dell deems fire coming out of the back of their computers as long as it was produced from \"wear and tear\" as a non-safety hazard.  From how this has been handled so far, one could think that \"wear and tear\" is expected to cause a Dell system to set fire, and that there is no surprise to my case.  Regardless of whether or not Dell thinks the situation was harmless, it very well was not harmless, as documented by the local PC repair shop I had taken the system to (I also have a picture of their formal report from the laptops attempted repairs).  It is clear to me that Dell\\'s support team would rather every other option then customer satisfaction and product safety.  \\n    If I was not standing next to the computer when it caught fire to unplug it from the wall to disconnect power, it could have potentially burned my house down.\\n\\nNot only do I have a video that shows what happens when I plug the battery into the computer, but I also have pictures of the scorched components and of the formal document given to me from the local PC repair shop.\\n\\n\\n***EDIT MUST READ***: Earlier today after I emailed the Dell CEO I received a call from Suneel Prasad.  He told me their stance remains the same, and that the situation has already been escalated to its fullest.  I don\\'t think they like all this bad publicity, what do you guys think?

At the very, very least, check all the main voltages of the power supply, by either trying the power supply in another motherboard or by disconnecting all the power connectors and doing the paperclip test and measuring with a multimeter.\n",

Sometimes it won't boot at all and gives CPU errors, sometimes it shows RAM errors (the ram is good and with a different cpu in that motherboard the ram works fine). It could be the CPU, but it could also be a faulty motherboard.\n",
      "Is the computer is passing the post test but not displaying anything? If it is your cpu is fine and it’s most likely a motherboard issue. Also are your fans PWM controlled? If your fans ramp up to 100% when you turn on the computer it’s 100% mobo. Also if you have any spare cabling, try changing them out.

      "Your computer will still receive power and be able to perform very BASIC tasks (running an OS is a no-go). These tasks are like making a first check to make sure everything is plugged in. The BIOS chip still gets power, and does not need the cpu to function in order for it to do it’s first job. With the red light, it could mean a variety of things, I recommend checking the documentation for your motherboard and seeing what the red light does. Usually they even blink a certain way or the computer will start beeping (so plug in any speakers you have if there is not one built in). The fact that your computer just stopped all of a sudden does not mean it’s a dead cpu, it could also mean hardware failure (IMO it’s way cheaper than a cpu repair) try starting with some basic troubleshooting techniques like what u/Linclin suggested.
