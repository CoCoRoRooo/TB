      "Wherever you're putting a hair dryer there's most likely a bad chip bad capacitor or bad resistor or bad transistor or bad solder joint somewhere.

      "\n",
      "But at the end of the day you could just have dirty power since the same symptom happened to two separate computers, have you tried a power conditioner in between your computer and your outlet?\n",
      "Well a hairdryer heats things up, sometimes a lot, maybe some component has a cracked solder joint and by heating it you temporarily seal the crack with thermal expansion of the material, if the computer does indeed remain on afterwards it means it's either a component that runs hot normally or it's something related to the power button and the process of turning on and it cooling down is irrelevant once the pc is on. Try playing around with the power button, disconnect it from the motherboard and short the pins with a screwdriver, if that doesn't work, check for a voltage between them if none is present it possibly means the crack is somewhere around the connector.\n",
      "I'm curious...does another hairdryer work too, or does it have to be the same one?\n",
      "Some passive components such as capacitors can be revived by mild heat once they fail. Motherboards happen to have lots of these passive componenets so that was likely that's what was happening.\n",
      "Sounds like it could be a humidity safety feature on the mobo acting up, bad sensor or excessive humidity in the room. Makes sense to me why it would work normally and boot up normally until you left it off for a few hours where it would go back to the same issues.\n",
      "weird stuff but;\n",
      "do you live in a cold area? it might be that the components get cold and retract/expand and loses contact and when you heat it up it expands and makes contact again? or does it have something to do with static electricity maybe?\n",
      "Almost sounds like when the computer goes through a heat cycle it craps out and when you are blowing the hair dryer on it I’m assuming it’s on full heat? And hairdryers on full heat will heat up computer components REAL fast, maybe just heating it up enough for the comp to turn on? Leads me to believe something with either a. Bad solder joints/bad resistor or something on mono, b. Humidity/temp issues, c. Bad power (yes I read about the ups but what exactly are your components? Is it a known good quality/working ups? If your using a psu that isn’t 80 plus rated that could well be the issue since most that aren’t rated are crappy), d. Is your mobo flexing due to the cpu cooler tension, have heard of this before and they just loosen the cpu cooler a bit and it magically works, sometimes doesn’t if the mobo is too badly damaged, could just be a picky psu or a cheap one.

      "Reset button tells the hardware to reset like it was just powered on. While modern journaling filesystems are pretty tolerant, you want to avoid a hard reset like that unless you have no other option (frozen machine) because the OS doesn’t have time to properly close open files and save configuration changes that happen after log off. Shutdown, while referring to powering off a pc, also refers to the OS shutting down as well.\n",

      "I had a bad experience with a Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD5 R5, the computer crashed by it self doing \"nothing\", you know when the screen freeze and you hear a huge noise/beep coming from the speakers, when I hit the \"reset\" button the computer start to do some kind of infinite loop, when it was about to start after the beep the motherboard resets it self infinite times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Latter I've discovered that the main bios got corrupted in a way that it could not be recovered by that \"Dualbios\" crap, to recover my board I had to short circuit the data pins of the first BIOS and while doing that, power up the machine so the Dualbios would kick in and I could do a bios update to restore everything back in order. Some say that I hit \"reset\" too early, that I should wait a few seconds so the motherboard could finish whatever it was doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a technical point of view, I don't believe the \"reset\" button would cause all that problem, but one thing we know for sure is that, if your computer is doing something like writhing data into the HDD or something in that nature and you hit \"reset\", you'll get tons of corrupted files.\n",

      "Un PC qui ne démarre pas (\"won't boot\") peut présenter plusieurs symptômes : absence totale de réaction au bouton d’alimentation, ventilateurs qui tournent mais aucun affichage, redémarrages en boucle, ou nécessité d'utiliser des astuces inhabituelles (comme le sèche-cheveux !) pour réussir à booter. Les causes peuvent être matérielles (alimentation, carte mère, RAM, CPU, humidité, connectique, etc.) ou logicielles (corruption système, incompatibilité de drivers, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "Les cas rapportés dans les sources montrent :\n",
      "- Des PC qui ne démarrent qu’après avoir été chauffés au sèche-cheveux : souvent lié à des problèmes de carte mère (soudure, trace fissurée, composant défectueux) ou à l’humidité.\n",
      "- Des redémarrages aléatoires ou arrêts brutaux : souvent dus à l’alimentation, à la carte mère, à la RAM ou à la connectique.\n",
      "- Des situations où tout semble sous tension (LEDs, ventilateurs) mais aucun affichage ni activité périphérique : carte mère ou CPU souvent en cause, parfois RAM.\n",
