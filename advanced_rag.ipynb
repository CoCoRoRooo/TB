Answer them (with exception of giving out any personal information - always read command outputs that you are copying and pasting and feel free to censor any sensitive info) as thoughtfully as you can even though you may think the answer is not relevant to your problem.

Unfortunately it seems these companies have no problem selling expensive gaming laptops but refuse to actually support them or even admit that they are dangerous due to them generally using power adapters that can barely meet demand and thermal designs that aren\\'t up to spec. There\\'s probably nothing you can do to get Dell to fix or replace your hardware but you really should post the pictures to their Facebook page and various gaming forums so people understand the kind of shit these companies like to pull. \\nWe can see some dust on his black case with a flash!

There is a component that is failing when the system is powered by battery. This is due to normal wear and tear and is not considered to be a potential safety issue.\\n\\n We are shipping the system back to you since the warranty on the system does not encourage any repairs unless you pay for the repairs to complete. I will update you once the tracking details are available.\\n\\n Regards,\\n\\nSuneel Prasad\\n\\nDell | Executive Customer Support Team\"\\n\\n \\n   This was the email I had received by the Dell representative Suneel Prasad in an attempt to close the complaint I had opened months ago about my Dell Alienware laptop catching fire.  Only 3 months prior to my Dell laptop catching fire, there had been issues with the computer straight out of the factory.  Dell had my laptop returned to them and fixed the issues, deeming it safe for use.\\n  After my laptop had spewed fire out of then back, leaving scorch marks on my desk, I contacted Dell and they simply told me \"If you are out of warranty then we unfortunately cannot do anything for you Sir\", with absolutely no concern for the fire.  I contacted the Better Business Bureau to assist with my case, and so they did.  \\n  After the Executive Dell Support team from Austin, Texas had been contacted it took months for the case to go anywhere.  This is mainly because Dell had lied to the BBB and myself, saying that they had already had an examination team examining my laptop and that they had found nothing of harm.  At this point, I had not sent Dell my laptop yet (I have this email documented from Dell).\\n   After I had caught them in their lie, Dell immediately sent me a box to return the laptop to them for actual examination.\\n   A month after sending them the laptop, Dell responded to me with the email stating that no component they had found was of any harm, and the incident was caused by normal \"wear and tear\".\\n  Regardless of what component has failed, and regardless of why it has failed, fire and smoke have came out of the back of the computer.  The inner components of the computer wouldn\\'t be scorched and melted unless they were heated to a temperature where fire was produced.  There is very clear evidence showed in the pictures I had taken of the laptops inner components.  It has become a regular occurrence for Dell to now tell me that my case is harmless.  I realize now that Dell deems fire coming out of the back of their computers as long as it was produced from \"wear and tear\" as a non-safety hazard.  From how this has been handled so far, one could think that \"wear and tear\" is expected to cause a Dell system to set fire, and that there is no surprise to my case.  Regardless of whether or not Dell thinks the situation was harmless, it very well was not harmless, as documented by the local PC repair shop I had taken the system to (I also have a picture of their formal report from the laptops attempted repairs).  It is clear to me that Dell\\'s support team would rather every other option then customer satisfaction and product safety.  \\n    If I was not standing next to the computer when it caught fire to unplug it from the wall to disconnect power, it could have potentially burned my house down.\\n\\nNot only do I have a video that shows what happens when I plug the battery into the computer, but I also have pictures of the scorched components and of the formal document given to me from the local PC repair shop.\\n\\n\\n***EDIT MUST READ***: Earlier today after I emailed the Dell CEO I received a call from Suneel Prasad.  He told me their stance remains the same, and that the situation has already been escalated to its fullest.  I don\\'t think they like all this bad publicity, what do you guys think?

With the red light, it could mean a variety of things, I recommend checking the documentation for your motherboard and seeing what the red light does. Usually they even blink a certain way or the computer will start beeping (so plug in any speakers you have if there is not one built in).

Plusieurs causes matérielles sont évoquées : RAM mal insérée, alimentation défectueuse, carte mère défaillante, connecteurs desserrés, ou encore problème de CPU (rarement). Des chocs physiques (coup, déplacement) peuvent également provoquer des dysfonctionnements en délogeant des composants.\n",

      "- Retirer puis réinsérer la carte graphique.\n",
      "- Vérifier que tous les câbles d’alimentation (24 pins, 8 pins CPU, PCIe) sont bien enfoncés.\n",
      "- S’assurer que le ventirad CPU est bien branché sur la prise CPU_FAN.\n",
      "- Vérifier l’absence de vis ou d’objets métalliques pouvant causer un court-circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 3 : Test d’alimentation**\n",

      "**Étape 4 : Réinitialisation du BIOS/CMOS**\n",
      "- Retirer la pile bouton de la carte mère pendant quelques minutes, puis la remettre.\n",
      "- Certains recommandent aussi de faire un clear CMOS via le jumper dédié.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 5 : Démarrage en configuration minimale**\n",
      "- Débrancher tous les périphériques non essentiels (disques, USB, GPU si le CPU possède un iGPU).\n",
      "- Ne laisser que la carte mère, le CPU, une barrette de RAM.\n",
      "- Tenter de démarrer et observer les réactions (bips, voyants, affichage).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 6 : Analyse des bips**\n",
      "- Si des bips sont émis, se référer au manuel de la carte mère ou aux sites spécialisés pour interpréter le code (ex : bips longs = RAM mal insérée, bips courts = problème GPU, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 7 : Inspection physique**\n",
      "- Après un choc, vérifier que rien n’a été déplacé ou endommagé (RAM, GPU, câbles, alimentation).\n",
