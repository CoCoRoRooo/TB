      "guide - technique  : iPhone 12 Screen Refurbishment https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+12+Screen+Refurbishment/138992\n",
      "Step 1:\n",
      "Firstly, let's run a cosmetic inspection of the screen. We can see that the iPhone 12 has a narrower bezel than the iPhone 11 Pro, so the iPhone 12 bezel may be a little easier to disassemble.\n",
      "In addition to that, the iPhone 12 bezel doesn’t wrap around the glass lens anymore. Therefore, the material requirements for the bezel adhesive will be relatively high to prevent the adhesive from falling off. To dig deeper, we will refurbish the iPhone 12 screen.\n",
      "Step 2:\n",
      "First of all, let’s test the screen. The display, touch, and 3D Touch all function well.\n",
      "Place the screen upside down on the Screen Separator, set the temperature to 100 ℃, and start the suction.\n",
      "Step 3:\n",
      "Remove the ear speaker flex cable first. Since the ear speaker flex cable is very easy to damage, please be noted that we need to heat the screen before removing it.\n",
      "Besides, the iPhone 12 ear speaker sensor ring is integrated into the bezel.\n",
      "Step 4:\n",
      "Now, let’s remove the bezel. Dip adhesive remover on the bezel first.\n",
      "While using the Razor Blade to separate the bezel, you need to dip some adhesive remover too.\n",
      "Slide the Razor Blade back and forth, and pry up the bezel carefully.\n",
      "Step 5:\n",
      "As the ear speaker flex cable part has more adhesive, we can dip more adhesive remover to make it loose.\n",
      "Hold the two corners of the bezel in both hands, and detach the bezel slowly with caution.\n",
      "Our original thought was to separate the bezel in a complete manner and then reuse it. But now the bezel is broken here. So please notice that this part of the bezel is made of plastic material, which is extremely easy to break. If you want to separate the bezel completely, you need to pay extra attention.\n",
      "Step 6:\n",
      "In order not to induce damage, we use a thin film to remove the flex cable part.\n",
      "Remove the bezel and it can be seen that the 3M adhesive used in the bezel flex cable part is no longer the cold adhesive. The 3M adhesive makes the bezel relatively easy to remove.\n",
      "Step 7:\n",
      "Remove excess adhesive on the ear speaker flex cable part.\n",
      "Start separating the OLED along the bottom layer of the glass lens with Cutting Wire.\n",
      "Through our observation, we found that the touch panel of the iPhone 12 screen is better than that of the iPhone 11 Pro, which is not easy to damage. To put it specifically, the touch panel of the iPhone 12 is thicker and the cut lines are clearer and wider.\n",
      "Step 8:\n",
      "Place the OLED on the heating platform.\n",
      "Roll up the OCA adhesive with the Electric Adhesive Removing Tool and remove the remaining OCA adhesive with a hand.\n",
      "Step 9:\n",
      "Connect the OLED and ear speaker flex cable. The display and touch function works well.\n",
      "A point worth mentioning is that not connecting the ear speaker flex cable will lead to the absence of light-sensing. The screen will be too dark to be tested.\n",
      "Step 10:\n",
      "Attach the OCA adhesive to the glass lens.\n",
      "Put the glass lens with OCA adhesive into the Bubble Removing Machine for 3 minutes.\n",
      "Then put it into the UV Lamp for Curing OCA Glue for 5 seconds.\n",
      "Step 11:\n",
      "Wipe clean the OLED and use the pull tape to stick a corner of the glass lens.\n",
      "Press the pull tape for seconds and then tear off the protective film of the OCA adhesive.\n",
      "Step 12:\n",
      "Since the iPhone 12 aligning mold has not come out yet, we use manual alignment.\n",
      "After alignment, place the screen on the laminating sponge.\n",
      "Please notice that two slots are cut on the sponge in order to prevent OLED damage.\n",
      "Step 13:\n",
      "Put the screen into the laminating machine and press “LCD laminate start”.\n",
      "Take out the screen and we can see there are bubbles on the screen.\n",
      "Step 14:\n",
      "Put the screen back into the Bubble Removing Machine for 10 minutes and then put the screen into the UV Lamp for Curing OCA Glue for 180 seconds.\n",
      "Assemble the refurbished screen on the phone and all functions work well.\n",

      "guide - technique  : Repair LCD screen https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Repair+LCD+screen/95912\n",
      "Step 1:\n",
      "This model does not have a viewfinder and requires the LCD display to take pictures, so trouble shooting is difficult.\n",
      "Turn the knob to &quot;Auto&quot; mode and make sure the shutter is not stuck. Take a few test pictures while looking INTO the lens so you can see whether the shutter closes and opens.  Also Zoom in and zoom out to check if the aperture  opens and closes.\n",
      "Next, test the zoom lens is working and the mechanism is moving smoothly - without catching or grinding. The zoom can be knocked crooked, and can be very gently pushed back into place.\n",
      "Step 2:\n",
      "Next, press the MENU button on the back of the camera and listen for the typical change in sound. Move the selection buttons and listen for the beeps to ensure the options are changing (since you can't see it on screen).\n",
      "Press the shutter button to make sure the camera can take pictures.  Since the screen is not working, just listen for the proper timing and sounds (does the auto focus work? does the red light come on/off on? Does it beep once the auto focus is complete?)\n",
      "Step 3:\n",
      "Turn off camera and connect via USB cable. Make sure the camera is charged sufficiently so that it doesn't shut off.\n",
      "Turn on the camera and wait for the computer to recognize it as a new device.   Explore the image files from the directory to make sure that the previous test shots you made are saving. If the pictures are there, then you know the camera works.\n",
      "If there is no Memory Card, delete the photos from the DCIM file on your computer, and take more test shots. The camera has limited internal memory and might not capture shots if the memory is already full.\n",
      "Step 4:\n",
      "CHECK TO SEE FLAT CABLE IS LOOSE  at the base on the metal arms. If the LDC screen is disconnected, this will be loose or sticking out. Otherwise, you  should only see it coming out the back of the LCD screen.\n",
      "Use Phillips screwdriver to remove the plate over the cable and the screws on the bottom left and bottom right corners of the arm.  KEEP TRACK OF SCREWS, the ones connecting the arms to the camera body will be market with blue/color.\n",
      "Once arm is removed,  remove the screws around the LCD screen to take apart the assembly.  THIS IMAGE IS NOT THE EXACT MODEL but it helped me take the LCD assembly apart.\n",
      "Take off the protective cover (like in photo) and use something thin and flat to pry the LCD screen from the metal frame.  On the back of the interior LCD screen is the connection to the camera body.\n",
      "Step 5:\n",
      "You need <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/en-eu/products/tweezers\" class=\"product-link\">tweezers</a>, very bright light and magnifying glass to reconnect the cable.  TEST TO SEE IF SCREEN WORKS, does it light up (if cable is installed upside down, the screen will light up but not show images).\n",
      "If the screen DOES light up, start reassembling the entire LCD mechanism.  TURN OFF camera and (1) Connect the arms back onto the camera body, making sure to place flat cable through the slot in the LCD frame.\n",
      "(2) There will be very little room to connect the cable, use the magnifier and light see clearly, and use the tweezers to push the cable connection firmly into the slot on the back of the interior LCD screen.\n",
      "(3) TURN ON the camera to test if the screen is working properly. This step took a few tries before the display worked properly, so try it several times! The connector must be inserted fully and evenly otherwise the screen will light up, but no image will be shown.\n",
      "Step 6:\n",
