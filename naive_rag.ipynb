They can be really odd when they fail. A few straight up fail sounding like gun shots, others you take a nap and no matter what it won't power on. And the wierd ones cause random restarts and only work at specific intervals\n",

This always fixed after a while and I used to be able to turn back, so perhaps you either have a failing psu or motherboard here\n",

I really dont know whats the issue anymore cuz I tried all that I could.\n",

      "Final edit: We went to a shop that my friend swears by and told us that we should just leave the pc with them. 1 hour later they called us and said it was a mobo problem. They suspect it has something to do with the frequent power interruptions cuz backwater country (which still doesnt make sense cuz I left it off for 10 days). Also a standard matx board here is like 2-3 weeks of minimum wage-Its not the worse case scenario but I have to sacrifice some for the pc I guess. The pc is running fine at the moment and hopefully theres no update coming from me anymore cuz I would lose it at that point.\n",

      "🔍 **Analyse du problème** :\n",
      "\n",
      "Un PC qui ne démarre pas (ne \"boote\" pas) peut avoir de multiples causes, allant de soucis matériels (alimentation, câbles, composants mal connectés ou défectueux) à des problèmes liés à l'environnement électrique (prise murale, qualité du courant, etc.). Les guides techniques et posts Reddit analysés montrent que les causes les plus fréquentes sont : des composants ou câbles desserrés, une alimentation défectueuse, des problèmes de RAM ou de carte graphique, ou encore des soucis de carte mère. Des facteurs externes comme des chocs physiques ou une mauvaise qualité du courant électrique peuvent également provoquer ou aggraver ces problèmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ **Vérifications préalables recommandées** :\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **S’assurer que le PC est bien alimenté** (prise, multiprise, câble d’alimentation, interrupteur ON/OFF sur l’alimentation).\n",
      "2. **Tester la prise murale** (essayer une autre prise ou un autre appareil sur la même prise).\n",
      "3. **Débrancher tous les périphériques externes** (USB, imprimantes, etc.).\n",
      "4. **Observer les signes de vie** : LED, ventilateurs, bruit du disque, etc.\n",
      "5. **Vérifier visuellement l’intérieur du boîtier** (recherche de câbles ou composants déplacés, poussière excessive, odeur suspecte de brûlé).\n",
      "\n",
      "📝 **Procédure détaillée proposée** :\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 1 : Ouvrir le boîtier et vérifier les connexions**\n",
      "- Débranchez le PC du secteur.\n",
      "- Ouvrez le boîtier.\n",
      "- Resserrez tous les câbles (alimentation, SATA, connecteurs carte mère, etc.).\n",
      "- Rebranchez correctement la RAM et la carte graphique (GPU), en vous assurant qu’elles “cliquent” en place.\n",
      "- Vérifiez que le GPU est bien vissé et bien droit dans son slot PCIe (éviter le \"GPU sag\").\n",
      "- Vérifiez que le ventilateur du CPU est bien fixé.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 2 : Tester l’alimentation (PSU)**\n",
      "- Vérifiez le câble d’alimentation et essayez-en un autre si possible.\n",
      "- Si le PC ne s’allume pas du tout (pas de LED, pas de ventilateurs), essayez de brancher l’alimentation sur une autre prise ou utilisez une multiprise/UPS.\n",
      "- Si vous sentez une odeur d’ozone ou de brûlé, l’alimentation est peut-être HS.\n",
      "- Si possible, testez avec une autre alimentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 3 : Vérifier la RAM et la carte graphique**\n",
      "- Retirez puis réinstallez les barrettes de RAM une par une.\n",
      "- Essayez de démarrer avec une seule barrette, puis changez de slot.\n",
      "- Retirez la carte graphique et essayez de démarrer avec la sortie vidéo de la carte mère (si disponible).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 4 : Réinitialiser le CMOS**\n",
      "- Localisez le jumper CMOS sur la carte mère ou retirez la pile bouton quelques minutes puis remettez-la.\n",
      "- Cela réinitialisera les paramètres du BIOS, ce qui peut résoudre certains blocages.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 5 : Vérifier l’environnement électrique**\n",
      "- Si le PC fonctionne ailleurs mais pas chez vous, faites vérifier vos prises et la qualité du courant (tension instable, prises usées).\n",
      "- Essayez de brancher le PC dans une autre pièce ou sur un onduleur (UPS).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Étape 6 : Tester les autres composants**\n",
      "- Débranchez tous les disques durs/SSD pour voir si le PC affiche au moins un écran de BIOS.\n",
      "- Si possible, testez la carte mère chez un professionnel ou remplacez-la en dernier recours.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 **Conseils supplémentaires ou précautions à prendre** :\n",
      "\n",
      "- Évitez de manipuler ou de secouer votre PC : les chocs peuvent déloger des composants fragiles.\n",
      "- Si vous avez récemment subi une coupure de courant ou des fluctuations électriques, envisagez l’achat d’un onduleur (UPS) pour protéger votre matériel.\n",
      "- Si vous sentez une odeur de brûlé ou entendez des bruits inhabituels, coupez immédiatement l’alimentation et faites diagnostiquer le PC par un professionnel.\n",
      "- Prenez des photos avant de déconnecter les câbles pour faciliter le remontage.\n",
      "- Travaillez sur une surface plane, avec les mains propres et idéalement un bracelet antistatique.\n",
